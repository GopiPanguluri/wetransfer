                        Hi everyone. Sam Ovens here, and welcome to this training module called &quot;Campaign Genesis.&quot; In this module we are going to launch the variations of ads and audiences, and images that you have created, and this is where all of the work, and everything that you&#039;ve done up until this point in week five it really comes to its fruition. It&#039;s where we take all of the hard work you&#039;ve done, and we launch it, and we bring it to life. This is probably the most exciting module up until this point because we actually get to publish your variations, and your ads, and everything, and we get to put them into the real world, and really test our hypothesis. I&#039;m looking forward to getting this done, so let&#039;s jump right into it.


Here&#039;s what we&#039;re going to cover on today&#039;s training. We&#039;re going to start off by discussing how we prepare the Garden of Eden for testing. We&#039;ve got an ad account checklist that we want to go through just to make sure that we&#039;ve got everything set up correctly before we launch our ads. Like I said throughout this training 95% of the results that you get with Facebook ads happen off of Facebook ads. It&#039;s 95% preparation, and 5% application. You&#039;re going to see in this training module how it&#039;s really easy to launch some ads. I mean anyone can launch some ads, but not anyone can create a profitable long-term advertising campaign, so this is where all of your hard work is really going to pay off. We&#039;re going to go through this ad account checklist, and make sure that everything is ready to go.


Then we&#039;re going to create the sterile campaign hosts, so before we can really launch all of the different variations you&#039;ve got we need to create some sterile hosts, which means like totally empty brand new campaigns, and they&#039;re going to host all of the different variations that we&#039;ve got. I&#039;m going to show you how to set those up the right way, how to name them, how to make sure the settings are all correct, and so on. Then we&#039;re going to inject our swan at DNA variance. This is where we publish your ad and audience templates, and we go live. We&#039;ve got all these different variations. We&#039;ve got five different ad angles. We&#039;ve got four images per ad angle, and then we&#039;ve got 30 different audience interests.


Now the possible combinations between all of those things is 600. That means we&#039;ve got 600 different types of DNA for testing, and we&#039;re hoping that within that sample size of 600 we are going to have some successful combinations of DNA, and produce some blue swans. Blue swans are profitable ad sets, and that&#039;s what we are hoping to do. If you&#039;ve done all of the steps sequentially in this process so far we should have no problem doing that at all.


In the final step, the step everyone has been looking forward to Campaign Genesis: Let there be traffic, clicks and light. This is where we are going to launch everything like hit the publish button, and everything is going to feed into our Facebook account, and it&#039;s going to build our complex campaign with a lot of different variations, and it&#039;s going to do it like effortlessly. You&#039;ll see how easy it is to do when you have set everything up properly, and you&#039;ve followed this process, which I&#039;ve laid out for you. Then we&#039;re going to observe it go live, and we&#039;re going to make sure it goes live, and all of our ads are approved, and everything. Then once we can start to see some campaign life, which means people clicking on our ads, serving impressions, things like that then we are good to go, and we&#039;re going to leave it for its incubation period.


With that being said let&#039;s jump right into today&#039;s training. At this stage of the Facebook training you should have everything ready to go live. The only thing left to do is launch, and this module of the training is going to show you exactly how to do that, so let&#039;s get to work. First step. Preparing the Garden of Eden for testing. This is our ad account checklist. If you remember from all the other modules we call the first four days of a Facebook campaign the Garden of Eden. It&#039;s the most important four days of our ad&#039;s life because that&#039;s where the initial conditions are going to really combine with all of our different variations, and it&#039;s going to either create some really good ads, or it&#039;s going to create some not good ads, probably a combination of the both.


This Garden of Eden period is extremely important. It&#039;s important that we have everything set up correctly before we go and publish our ads. We&#039;re going to go through this ad account checklist right now, and make sure you&#039;ve got everything set up and ready to go. Step one. At this stage of the training you should have all these things ready to go, so you should have your Facebook business manager account set up correctly. You should have multiple ad accounts set up. You should have a Facebook fanpage, and you should have some likes on that fanpage, and you should have images, and a description, and you should have put some posts on it, and all of that stuff. You should have a compliant website with all of the different terms and conditions, and privacy policy, and all of that, and enough content on it. All of this stuff is back in the Facebook&#039;s book of law module, so all of this stuff is absolutely mandatory.


You have should built out your fragmentation funnel, and not only built it you should have thoroughly tested it. You should have gone through and made sure everything is working. You should have your tracking systems set up correctly, and your conversion pixels thoroughly tested. You should also have a firm understanding of our KPI&#039;s and benchmarks as well as the tracking sheet that we use, so you should have tested that the Google tag manager is working correctly. You should have tested that the Facebook&#039;s mark pixel is on there, and you should have tested that the perfect audience pixel, and the Google and analytics pixel were all on your site on all of your pages, and firing correctly. You should also be familiar with our KPI&#039;s like what the benchmarks are like what are the safe ranges for all of our different metrics. You should know our funnel math. You should have looked at the tracking sheet that we use. You should have really familiarized yourself with these things.


Step three. You should have watched all of this weeks training modules from start to finish, so every module from zero in the beginning all the way to the end every minute of every training module. I know there is a lot of training, but it is so important that you watch all of this stuff, and you really take it in because it might not seem like you need to do it. Some people might be in a rush to just launch, but honestly it&#039;s going to come back and bite you in the ass because as soon as your stuffs launched you&#039;re going to run into issues. You&#039;re not going to know how to solve them, and you&#039;re not going to know what to do, so it is important that you watch all of these modules from start to finish.


You should also have completed all of the worksheets, and the different worksheets throughout week five&#039;s training is extracting fractal patterns worksheet. This is where we extract the fractal patterns from your proof of concept, and we really flush them out in a Google document so that we&#039;ve got lots of raw materials to mill for your Facebook ads. Then you should have created your Facebook audience angles and images worksheet. Now this is a worksheet that has a list of the 30 audience interests that you&#039;re going to target that you have derived from your Tower of Babel audience, and you should have also created five different ad angles, and then you should have created four different ad images to go with each angle. We call that your ad hypothesis that should be formed, and you should also have your audience hypothesis formed.


If you followed the instructions sequentially step-by-step up until this point then you should have all of the stuff done, and you should be able to nod your head, and agree that at this point all of these different things are done. If any of these things are not done then you must go back and complete them before you launch because I can promise you now that it&#039;s not going to work, and you will end up wasting your money and your time. You should have created a Qwaya account and loaded your two genetic templates and ready to go. This is your 5x ad angles, and within each ad angle you should have four images, and you should have also created your 30 audience interests. Now if all four of these things are done, and you&#039;re not fooling yourself you&#039;ve actually done all of these things, and you can honestly agree that all of these are done then awesome. You are ready to proceed to the next step. If not, don&#039;t fool yourself. Go and finish it, do it properly now.


Creating the sterile campaign hosts. Here&#039;s the workflow and the instructions. The hierarchy of cells within Facebook looks like this. At the top level we&#039;ve got the ad account. You&#039;ve got your ad account, and that&#039;s what all of your information is in. Then within an ad account the next level is campaigns, so you can create different campaigns. Then within a campaign you have ad sets. Then within ad sets you have ads. That&#039;s how it goes down. That&#039;s the hierarchy, or the structure. We can observe the structure of our desired campaign by looking at the Facebook&#039;s Golden Mean PDF. I&#039;ll pull that up on my screen right now. This is the PDF. It&#039;s available for download beneath this video, so you can have a look. This is what our ideal campaign structure looks like. It&#039;s got 600 possible variations.


The green ones are ads. The yellow ones are ad sets. The pink ones are campaigns, and the top one the blue one is an ad account. We can zoom right in and look at this. This is the hierarchy structure. Ad account, then the next level. Campaigns, then the next level. Ad sets and then the next level we have ads, and that&#039;s how it works that&#039;s the structure. Now we will go back to our instructions. At the ad account level we have the conversion pixel, so that&#039;s what we have at the top level. Up here within one ad account we have like one conversion pixel. This conversion pixel is going to store data, and it&#039;s going to learn, and basically become more intelligent about you, your offer, and what sort of people resonate with your offer, so up here that&#039;s where we have that.


Then in the next layer the campaign layer at the campaign level we have the conversion objective. Here we really set what we&#039;re aiming for. We tell Facebook&#039;s algorithm what we&#039;re trying to achieve, and it&#039;s called a conversion objective. For us all the time we&#039;re going to set our objective as conversions. When we set a conversion objective we&#039;re basically saying that we want people to opt in for our value video. We want email addresses that&#039;s our main conversion. That&#039;s what this campaign is going to be optimizing for. Now another way you can segment campaigns is by the type of traffic. We call the campaign a cold traffic campaign because we are targeting strangers who have never heard of us before, so within a campaign we have a type of traffic like cold traffic, and then we have an objective, which is website conversions.


Over here we&#039;re going to create another campaign, and this one is still optimizing for conversions, but the only difference is that the traffic is warmer. It&#039;s retargeting traffic, so people that have clicked on this ad and then left, and they&#039;ve already seen us in some way, shape, or form. It&#039;s important that we segment these two campaigns at this level, but then within our cold traffic campaign, which is where most of the horsepower of our Facebook efforts are going to be. This is where all of the magic really happens. Within here we have like 30 different ad sets. We&#039;ve got 600 different variations within here, 30 different audiences, five different angles, and four different images per angle, so there&#039;s a lot of complexity just within one of our campaigns. Then once we see what works and what doesn&#039;t we&#039;re going to start turning things off, and culling through these identifying blue swans from red swans.


Then when we identify some winners we&#039;re going to put those winners over in this retargeting campaign, and hit people from that angle as well, but right now in the beginning we&#039;re just worried about that one campaign. In the next layer down we have the ad set. At the ad set level we have the combination of one ad angle and one audience interest. Here we&#039;re saying one angle, which could be like my 26-year-old punk head, and then one audience, which could be Tony Robbins, right? So we&#039;re combining an angle in an audience, two things.


Up here we&#039;re just combining a type of traffic in an objective, and then up here we&#039;re just combining our ad account and a pixel, so there&#039;s a combination of different variables at each layer. Here you can see we might create angle one, and show it to audience one. Then here we might create angle two, and show it to audience one, but then here we might create angle one, and show it to audience two, so we&#039;re covering every possible combination of variables here. We&#039;re really architecting this thing so that the algorithm can flick through efficiently and try and optimize the right variation.


Then at the ad level we have the combination of one ad angle, and four ad images, so here, if we drill down to another layer, which is the green ads, so an ad contains an angle and an image. It&#039;s really showing one of our ad angles, and one of our images. Then we typically have four different image variations within one ad set, so for each angle we get to test four different images, and that&#039;s how it works. That is the Golden Mean. When you zoom right out you can really see how this looks. This is available for download. It&#039;s called Facebook&#039;s Golden Mean. It&#039;s a PDF, and you can zoom right in to get to understand the structure, and the hierarchy of this. It&#039;s available in the resources section for download.


What&#039;s interesting to note is that if you see here it says, &quot;There is inheritance between levels.&quot; This is another thing most people don&#039;t understand at all about Facebook. At every single level while we do believe there is some sort of isolation there is still inheritance. Just like with genetics you can&#039;t really say that you are entirely isolated from your parent&#039;s DNA, or their parent&#039;s DNA. I mean there is a huge difference, but there is some inheritance, so at each layer of this structure there is going to be inheritance, so at the ad account level as more people click on your ad, and as more people opt-in and convert the pixel is going to start building up intelligence. In it the campaign level your campaigns are going to start optimizing as well. They&#039;re going to start gaining intelligence about what works and what doesn&#039;t work. At the ad set level these are going to gain intelligence, and even at the ad level these are going to gain intelligence.


At each level there is inheritance, and every level affects every other level, so it&#039;s important to understand this, and get it set up correctly. That way when you really start tuning your Facebook account the right way once it starts to work out what works things really start picking up exponentially. Once you start getting enough intelligence on this pixel at the ad account level, well, you can start just targeting such broad audiences that you don&#039;t even need to specify audience interests anymore. With my ad account, for example, I&#039;ve had more than 700,000 conversions on my pixel, so that&#039;s a huge amount of conversions. I&#039;ve had millions of clicks, and I&#039;ve served up hundreds of millions of impressions, and to multiple different countries all around the world. My ad account is years old, so it&#039;s got a huge amount of intelligence built up on it.


When you do this it means that you can really just start targeting an entire country, and you don&#039;t need to specify any audiences, and it just works. I could target U.S. I could target Germany. I could target Australia, any country I want and my algorithm will go into that country, and it will find out who is interested in what I have. Now that&#039;s a luxury that you get once you&#039;ve built up your campaigns or the time, so if you follow all of these instructions, and you work with me eventually you will end up being able to do things like that, which gives you huge power. It gives you devastating power. Compared to any other advertiser if you have that sort of intelligence on your pixel, and if you have that sort of understanding the rest of the population really doesn&#039;t stand a chance against you, so that is what you want to be aiming for eventually.


Step three. Using Qwaya we can create and launch ad sets and ads, but in order to do that we need to manually create a campaign to host all of the variations. Qwaya can launch everything from the ad set layer down, but it can actually launch campaigns, but it&#039;s not very good at doing that, so we don&#039;t want to trust it with that. Then we go to step four. Within Facebook&#039;s power editor, we want to create two sterile campaigns called &quot;Cold Traffic: Conversions: Auto, and Retargeting traffic: Conversions: Auto.&quot; What I mean by sterile campaigns is campaigns that are totally empty. They don&#039;t have any ad sets, or ads within them, and they don&#039;t have any previous history. They&#039;re totally sterile, they&#039;re brand new. That way they won&#039;t carry over any sort of inheritance from old campaigns.


If you&#039;ve got other campaigns, and you&#039;ve run your own stuff in their before do not use those because they&#039;re going to have history, and inheritance from all of your previous activities. That&#039;s going to really skew the evolution of our ads. We need sterile hosts that we can use for this experiment, so they need to be brand new, no previous history, and with nothing in them at all. To do this we use the power editor. Why we&#039;re naming them Cold Traffic: Conversions: Auto, first of all, we&#039;re identifying the type of traffic because if you remember a campaign the variables that it houses within it is the type of traffic in a conversion objective, so we&#039;re saying that for our first campaign it&#039;s using cold traffic, and its conversation objective is conversions. Auto means that we&#039;re setting the bedding mechanism to auto instead of manual, so it&#039;s basically just a naming convention so that we know what&#039;s going on, and when we look into our ad accounts later on we can tell what&#039;s going on.


I see people sometimes create ad accounts, and start launching campaigns, and they type the names for their ads like X1, or JJJJ6, and it&#039;s such a mess no one knows what the hell is going on in there, so we need to avoid stuff like that happening if we want to actually be profitable with this, and remain sane, so what we&#039;re going to do is set this up right now. We&#039;re going to go to the power editor, so we go to Business.Facebook.com. Then you want to launch your number one ad account. I&#039;m just going to launch my number three ad account because that&#039;s the one I&#039;m doing for this demo. Then you want to hover over ads manager, and then go to power editor here. We need to use the power editor to launch campaigns not the ads manager. Then what we do up here make sure you&#039;re on the campaigns tab. Click create campaign, and we&#039;re naming this one. It&#039;s called &quot;Cold Traffic: Conversions: Auto.&quot; So, Cold Traffic Conversions Auto. Buying Type, auction. Then Campaign Objective, conversions, right? That&#039;s why we&#039;re saying Cold Traffic Conversions Auto.


Then leave ad set name empty, or we can go skip ad set. Then skip ad. Make sure you click on both of those. This is what I mean when I say sterile. It&#039;s brand new and it has no ad sets, and no ads within it, it&#039;s empty. Then we click create. Boom! That one is created there. Now we&#039;re going to create our other one while we&#039;re at it. We&#039;re going to click on create campaign. We&#039;re going to call this one &quot;Retargeting Traffic: Conversions: Auto.&quot; Option, objective, conversions, skip ad set, skip ad, create. Now we&#039;ve got both of these. Now you can see it says, &quot;In draft.&quot; This is because with power editor we create things in here, but we need to publish them, so then what we do is we click review changes up here, and then we apply it. It&#039;s applying, and now it&#039;s done. It will say &quot;Not delivering&quot; because there is no ad sets in here, and there&#039;s no ads in here. Of course, it&#039;s not delivering when there&#039;s nothing in it, but the main thing is that these are created, which is perfect. Now we can go back to our process.


Once you have both of these sterile campaign hosts published and live you can progress to the next step. Injecting swan DNA variants. This is when we publish your ad and audience templates. We&#039;ve created the cells, the hosts, which is the campaigns. Now it&#039;s time to really inject within those hosts all of our different variance of DNA, so let&#039;s do that right now. Here&#039;s the process, and the workflow for Injecting variants: Publishing your ads and audiences. Step one. Now that we have checked over our ad account, and created our sterile campaign hosts we are ready to launch our variations, and go live for testing. Make sure that you follow this process carefully because this process here we&#039;re going to show you how to publish everything, and how to go live. It&#039;s really important that you make sure that all of this stuff is correct because if you mess the stuff up you can make one hell of a mess in your ad account, and you won&#039;t even be able to make heads or tails of it. You&#039;ll just botch your whole experiment, so please make sure you work through this methodically.


Step number two. Depending on your testing budget, which you will have set back in an earlier module in week five&#039;s training where we discussed downside, and asymmetric testing, and all of that you should have calculated how much money you can afford to spend when it comes to testing, so this number needs to be at least 1-1/2 thousand dollars. That&#039;s just the minimum amount for testing. You can use less money, but it&#039;s not even worth me creating a training on because it&#039;s just like cowboy stuff. There&#039;s no real science to it, it&#039;s just like gambling. If you want to test with money below that it&#039;s fine, but I honestly don&#039;t have a method for that, and it&#039;s mostly just a fluke game, however, if you want to test properly you&#039;ll need at least 1-1/2 thousand dollars in testing budget allocated, and ideally some more than that, but that&#039;s the minimum. Depending on your testing budget you may need to sacrifice some of the variations in your templates.


The first thing you want to think back to is what budget did you set for testing, what was that number? Think about that number right now what was it, write it down. Then what you want to do is view the variation&#039;s calculator, and the resources to find out how many variations that you can actually work with because we probably need to trim our variations depending on your budget, so there&#039;s a resource available for download beneath this video. It&#039;s an Excel file and it&#039;s called &quot;Budget and Variation Calculator.&quot; You can download this to your computer in the resources section beneath the video, and then you can open it up on using Excel. Then click this link here to open it using Google Docs. I recommend using Google Docs for all of these.


Once you&#039;ve got it open you will notice that there is one cell up the top, which is highlighted in yellow your testing budget. This is where you enter in your testing budget, so the total overall amount of money. Now it needs to be at least 1-1/2 thousand dollars. It should ideally be more. Let&#039;s say for this demo I&#039;m just going to enter in 1,500, that&#039;s what I&#039;m going to go with. Now the minimum number of days this is six to 10, so the only number you&#039;re editing is this yellow one. Everything else stays constant, so the minimum amount of days for testing is 10. If we&#039;re doing it for anything less than that we&#039;re not going to see anything. We&#039;re just going to be looking at noise. No, you can&#039;t just spend like a small amount of money for three days. You&#039;re not doing anything. It&#039;s just like you may as well be gambling with it, so we need to go for at least 10 days, and then the minimum daily budget per ad set is $10.


This number cannot be any lower. You cannot advertise on Facebook for what we&#039;re doing and spend anything less than $10 per ad set per day in budget. Now you just have to trust me on that number because the way it is calculated is two times KPI. KPI for us can be in between $5 and $10, so I&#039;m already being generous on it by saying at least $10. You can spend less than that if you want, however, I can guarantee you it just won&#039;t work, so you just got to trust me on these numbers. I&#039;ve spent many, many millions more than you on Facebook ads. I know the different variables, and what these numbers should be, so you enter in your testing budget. If you&#039;re going for 10 days and if you&#039;re spending $10 per day per ad set that means that your total daily ad spend budget will be $150 a day, so you&#039;ll be spending $150 a day for 10 days to do your test. That will cost you a total, obviously, of 1,500 bucks.


Now over here it&#039;s going to tell us the number of possible ad sets, which is 15 because if we have to advertise for 10 days that means that we&#039;ve only got 150 bucks a day, and if we&#039;ve only got 150 bucks a day, and the minimum daily budget per ad set is 10 bucks that means we&#039;ve got 15 possible ad sets. Now there&#039;s some instructions here. It says enter your testing budget. Find out your number of possible ad sets. Then look that number up on the table below to determine how many variations of ad angles and audience interests you should test. Down here it says Golden Mean ratio of ad angles and audiences. I&#039;ve calculated all of the different metrics for you, or all of the different numbers for you. All of this stuff is like based on millions of dollars in testing, so you can trust these numbers are going to be a lot better than a guess, or advice from someone else who has spent anything less than like five million bucks on Facebook, all right?


Number of possible ad sets 15, so I look up 15 on this table here. It says, &quot;Possible ad angle should be two, and possible audience interests should be eight.&quot; That means I&#039;m only going to get to use two of my ad angles, and I&#039;m only going to get to use eight of my audience interests. Even though I came up with 30 audience interests, and five ad angles I&#039;m only going to get to test two and eight, and this is dictated to me because of my budget. Here&#039;s the Golden Mean numbers over here is ad angles five, and then audience interests 30. That gives us 600 possible combinations. Now if you were to test the Facebook&#039;s Golden Mean the way I&#039;ve shown you it all at one go, which you can do, I mean I do it all the time it&#039;s very expensive. It would cost you 1-1/2 thousand dollars a day to use Facebook&#039;s Golden Mean for testing.


If you are able to spend that much money by all means do it, but I understand that a lot of people this is just not doable, so what we do in that case is we reduce it down, and we remove some of the variations, so you get less possible combinations. Now you might be wondering why did I get you to create five angles and come up with 30 audience interests if you&#039;re only going to be using two and eight, for example. The reason why is because eventually you&#039;re going to use all of them because really depending on your budget it&#039;s just going to take you more time, so if you&#039;ve got more money then you can work really fast, but the less money you have the longer amount of time it&#039;s going to take. That&#039;s kind of the trade-off.


It&#039;s like the more you can spend in daily ad spend the faster you&#039;re going to get your results, and the faster you&#039;re going to scale. The less you can spend the longer it&#039;s going to take to do your testing, and the longer it&#039;s going to take to scale, and that&#039;s just kind of the trade-off. It still means you&#039;ll get to test every possible combination within the Golden Mean. It&#039;s just not immediately. Now if I was to change this testing budget to 3,000 it says my number of possible ad sets is 30, and I would be spending $300 a day, $10 in ad spent, $10 in ad set, daily budget, and then minimum number of days would be 10, which would equal 3,000. Then if I look up 30 here it says, &quot;I would have two ad angles with 15 audience interests.&quot; That means that I would have 120 possible combinations of ads, so this is still huge like as you can see even in the smallest instance here we have 60.


You&#039;ve got to remember that the normal person on Facebook has one, so we&#039;re still 60 times a hit, however, to get to the ultimate Facebook&#039;s Golden Mean here where it&#039;s at its sweet spot it&#039;s 600 possible combinations, 30 audience interests, five ad angles. That&#039;s 150 possible ad sets, which means that we need to have 1-1/2 thousand dollars a day to do that, but it&#039;s fine we can still do it. It just takes time. I&#039;m going to say just for example say that my testing budget is 1-1/2 thousand dollars, so that means I&#039;ve got 15 possible ad sets. Then I look it up on this table here I get to use two ad angles and eight audience interests, so two and eight. All right, I&#039;ll go back to my instructions. It says, &quot;Depending on your testing budgets we may need to sacrifice some variations.&quot; We&#039;ve already done that.


Now step three. Using the budget and variations calculator find out how many possible ad and audience combinations you can test with initially. Then select, which ads you will first test, and, which audiences you will test first as well. Then what you want to do is create a fragment of the original audience template called &quot;Fragment one.&quot; I&#039;ll show you what this means. If we go into Qwaya, and if we look at our targeting here, and if I double-click on this, and if I look over here in the potential reach it&#039;s just loading it says, &quot;Splits into 30 segments.&quot; So what happens is if I drag this into here you can see up here in brackets it says 30, so it&#039;s creating 30 audience interests. What happens if I go to create ads, and if I am to drag this here, well, you can see it creates 20 ads, and 20 and 30 that&#039;s 600. To do that we need 150 ad sets, which we can&#039;t do, so this is why it&#039;s dictated by our budget. I&#039;m only allowed to use with my budget two ad angles and eight audience interests, so I go to Qwaya.


First of all, I want to select what ad angles I&#039;m going to test first. I get two, so a good idea is to prioritize these in order by which ones you think are going to work the best, so it&#039;s just a guess. You&#039;ve got to think, which one would I put forward, you know, if I had a gun to my head, which one would I go with, so I&#039;m going to go with 26-year-old punk, and then I&#039;m going to go with Nine entrepreneurs jet. Let&#039;s just say that&#039;s what I&#039;m going to do, so what you want to do is once you&#039;ve figured out your priority right click on it, then go rename, and then just put a number in front of it, so you know. Then rename these and prioritize them. It&#039;s important to do this because we don&#039;t get to test them all at once, so we&#039;ve got to come up with some sort of method for prioritizing them.


Once you&#039;ve renamed your ad angles here I know I&#039;m going to go with this one, and this one first, those are the two I get to use because it was dictated by my budget here. Now I get eight possible audience interests, so if I go back to Qwaya this time and I click on set targeting, and if I double-click on this you can see here that I&#039;ve got 30, so I need to get rid of a whole bunch because I&#039;m only allowed eight. Instead of editing this because this is our master list here what we do is we click duplicate, and we create a copy. In this one here we rename, and we call this one Fragment one. Basically, what this is it&#039;s a fragment of this one, and then what we do is we double-click on this, and we have to trim this up. We&#039;ve got 30 in here.


We need to get it down to eight, so we need to get rid of a whole bunch of things from here, and get this down to eight, so the way you want to do it is just reduction just one by one you want to just keep the best eight that you think you&#039;ve got. Now a quick hint these are typically going to be closer to the top of the list because the way we created our list of audience interests we first of all came up with our Tower of Babel audience, and then we derived the other audiences from that based on affinity, so there is a higher probability of good audiences being at the top of the list than the bottom. Typically, you want to trim from around the bottom, and we want to bring this down to ...


Now I&#039;m at 14. I&#039;ve got to keep trimming, but let&#039;s say I get rid of these. You just want to remove the ones, which, sometimes you&#039;ll be like, &quot;I really want to target that one,&quot; but you can&#039;t. Your budget is going to dictate how many you can actually target, so now I&#039;ve got it down to eight segments. Now what I want to do is hit save. Now we&#039;ve still got our master list here. This one here it still has 30 audience interests in it, but we&#039;ve just created a fragment of this one. Now, eventually, like over time we&#039;re going to test all of the 30 in here. We just have to do it eight at a time.


Eventually, we&#039;re going to test all five ad angles here, but we just have to do it two at a time, so we get to use all of our variations, which we created, but we just don&#039;t get to do it all at once because we don&#039;t quite have the budget to support it. We&#039;re still doing it just over a longer period of time. Once you&#039;ve done that, once you&#039;ve created your fragment audience, and you&#039;ve prioritized your ads, and you figured out how many ad angles and audience interests you can use go back to instructions. We&#039;ve completed step three.


Now step four. Before we launch the entire storm of variations we want to test that our ads are compliant with Facebook and get past the approval process. To do this we launch all of our ads, but to one times audience only to reduce risk, so what this means is we&#039;ve never published these ads on Facebook before. Because we haven&#039;t published them we don&#039;t know whether there&#039;s anything in there that Facebook isn&#039;t going to like. Maybe they don&#039;t like an image. Maybe they don&#039;t like some of the wording we used. We can think that we&#039;re compliant, and we should have followed all the rules, but sometimes, you just get pulled up on things that you honestly didn&#039;t even know you were doing wrong, and it&#039;s totally normal.


To reduce our risk we don&#039;t want to go and launch everything because, for example, if I launched 30 different audience interests, and five different ads with four images each that is 600 like ads that I&#039;m going to launch, and if I launch 600 ads, and Facebook disapproves them, well, that&#039;s 600 disapprovals on my account, and that&#039;s going to look really bad. That&#039;s how you get your account shut down. It would have been wiser before I launched 600 of them to just launch a couple of them first, and just see if they&#039;re going to get through the approval process because if they do get through the approval process if one of them gets through then all of them should get through that&#039;s kind of how Facebook works. It&#039;s more strict on brand new ads, and then the first time you get a brand new ad approved then you can just publish lots of it because it&#039;s already been through the approval process, but in the beginning stages when we&#039;ve got brand new ads we just want to submit one of them at a time, and make sure that they&#039;re going to get approved.


To do this you go to create ads tab. Then use template. Then from this dropdown list you want to select your number one, and number two priority ad, and this should be, you know, you&#039;re using however many ad angles you have given your budget, so in this demo that I&#039;m showing you right now because my budget is 1,500 I only get to use two ad angles, and eight audience interests. If your budget is higher, and you&#039;re using four or five then when you&#039;re testing with Facebook to make sure that your ad is going to get approved you would drag like all five in here, all right? Then what you want to do is click set targeting. Then how we do this is we double-click on Fragment one, and what happens is Fragment one is split into eight segments, so if I was to drag Fragment one in here it&#039;s going to create eight different audiences. We don&#039;t want that because it&#039;s going to create a different ad per audience, and that&#039;s driving up our numbers. If we get disapproved, well, that&#039;s really bad.


So I&#039;m just going to remove this. What we do instead is we just uncheck the split button here, and then what we do is just click use. That combines all of them into one, so now we&#039;ve just got our eight ads, and we&#039;re only showing them to one audience, so that means there&#039;s only really eight, you know, eight and one that&#039;s just eight, so if we get all of our ads disapproved, which is unlikely because no one is going to get 100% of their ads disapproved unless you broke all of the rules. Our worst possible case is we&#039;re going to get eight disapprovals, but more likely our worse possible case is just like two or three disapprovals, which is totally fine. We&#039;re not going to get into much trouble for that, so we&#039;re minimizing our risk.


Then what you want to do is click on published ads, and then you want to click generate eight ads, and now this pop-up will come up. You&#039;ll see two tabs Basic Settings, and Tracking Settings. Select Tracking Settings, and make sure all three of these are checked, Google analytics, Facebook pixel tracking, and your pixel here, all three, this is crucial. Then go back to basic settings, and you want to click existing campaign because we&#039;re not using a new campaign because we created our sterile campaign hosts. Now you click this dropdown arrow here, and you should be able to see your campaigns. Now a common issue with Qwaya is that you won&#039;t be able to see your campaigns here, right? It happens to everyone all the time. Now I&#039;ll show you what the fix is because I know it&#039;s just going to trip everyone up, so you click on my campaigns. Then over here you click on download, and then you select ads and campaigns, and then OK. Now over here we can see that it&#039;s downloading. Campaigns and ads are downloaded, perfect.


Then you would go back to publish ads. Then you would hit generate eight ads, and then you would select existing campaign. Then you should be able to see your campaigns from the dropdown list here. Now I&#039;m going to select the Cold Traffic: Conversions: Auto, then tracking settings. We want to make sure all three are on here. Then our conversion pixel we want to select that. Event to promote you want to select lead. Ad set name you just want to write CPM-A. This stands for Cost Per Impression and Automatic. Then what we do is add set budget. This is $10 we can&#039;t go a dollar below that, and don&#039;t even worry. We&#039;re not even spending this money right now. This is just to see if our ads get approved or not. Once they get approved, we&#039;re just deleting them anyway.


Then we&#039;re going to optimize for offsite conversions and pay for impressions. This is why I wrote CPM-A because we&#039;re paying for impressions, but we&#039;re optimizing for conversions, and our max bid is auto, so CPM-A, that&#039;s what it stands for. Then what we do is we click generate ads. It will generate our ads like this. Now these are sitting here ready to go. Then what we do is we click publish ads. Then we go OK, and boom! Just like that Qwaya is now publishing our ads, and it says up here, &quot;Ads cued for publication.&quot; Qwaya is pushing out these ads into the Facebook platform right now. Now it can&#039;t do them all instantaneously. It has to do them not one at at time, but there&#039;s a maximum rate that it&#039;s allowed to sync data to Facebook, so what we can do is we click on business manager, and then we open up our number one ad account. I&#039;m just using this number three ad account for demo purposes. You&#039;ll be using your number one ad account.


Then we want to select the campaign Cold Traffic: Conversions: Auto. Then we will see our ad set. It&#039;s just called CPM-A. We can click on that, and here we will see our different ads, so in the beginning they will say, &quot;Pending review.&quot; Right? I don&#039;t know why mine got approved so fast that is rare. Most of the time it takes a while to get them approved. How long does it take? That varies a lot. Sometimes, I&#039;ve seen ads get approved instantly just like it happened then. Sometimes, I&#039;ve seen it take up to like 12 hours or 24 hours. Now that&#039;s a very rare case. Most of the time it happens within 10 minutes or something, but if you&#039;re in the boat that takes like more than one hour, two hours, three hours it&#039;s totally fine. It happens every now and then. It kind of sucks, but you just have to wait until your ads are approved.


What we want to do is wait until everything is approved because we want to make sure that our ads are compliant. The last thing we want to do is just inject a whole bunch of ads in here that are going to get disapproved because we&#039;re going to get our account shut down pretty much from the very beginning. Now once you&#039;ve got all of your ads approved I&#039;m just going to assume all of my ads have been approved here. What you want to do is you want to go to campaigns here. Make sure you un-select that, and then click on ad set. Campaigns should have nothing selected, and then ad set should just have this one ad set selected, then you want to click on more and delete and then delete. Now why I deleted that is because the only reason why I published it in the first place was to test that my ads were going to get approved by Facebook. Now that they are approved it&#039;s fine. I know that the coast is clear, and I can send through my army of ads.


However, if your ads do not get approved then you need to see why they didn&#039;t get approved, and then what you need to do is you need to fix it. You need to change the image, or you need to change the wording in your ad, or whatever it is that you got pulled up on, and then you need to submit it again, and do another test. You just need to keep trying it out until you know that you&#039;re compliant with Facebook, and you can get through their approval process, but if you follow the rules pretty much everyone should be able to get their ads through. Now what we&#039;ve got is we&#039;ve just got our two sterile campaign hosts again because I removed everything from within them. Then what we can do is go back to our instructions. Now we&#039;ve tested this. The coast is now clear. Our ads look like we&#039;re good to go.


Step five. It says, &quot;Drag your ads template and your audience template within Qwaya to create the different variations, and then click publish ads and then generate ads.&quot; Now what we&#039;re going to do is we&#039;re actually going to launch our ads for real, so not for testing anymore for actual real use. We&#039;re going to click on set targeting. We&#039;re going to select this, remove selected. Then we&#039;re going to click on create ads. We&#039;re going to clear creatives. Now what we want to do is go to use template, and this time we&#039;re only going to drag like one of these here, so it&#039;s just your first one. If you&#039;re only testing with two then you&#039;d only select one here. You have to do just one ad angle at a time, very important. You can&#039;t just drag the whole lot in here it will mess everything up, so one ad angle in, and it should just say four because that&#039;s one ad angle with four image variations.


Then we click on set targeting. Then we select Fragment one here, and we want to double click it. It&#039;s very important this should be set to split and this should say eight segments, right? Whatever number was dictated to you here by your budget, so I got two ad angles, and eight audience interests, but to start with you have to just launch one ad angle at a time, so in here I&#039;m going to go use, and now it&#039;s created my eight audience interests here. Then I&#039;ve got four ads because there&#039;s four different images, but with only one ad angle, right? Then what I want to do is hit publish ads, and then I want to go generate 32 ads. Now what I want to do is go to the tracking settings, and make sure all three of these are selected, Google analytics tracking, Facebook pixel tracking, and my specific Facebook pixel, very important, this is crucial.


In basic settings I want to select existing campaign. Select the dropdown box, and I want to select Cold Traffic: Conversions: Auto. Now very quickly if you can&#039;t see yours here then click on my campaigns, and then click on download, and then ads and campaigns, and then go OK. You&#039;ll see it&#039;s downloading from Facebook. It might take a while, and then it will say, &quot;Success,&quot; and it will say, &quot;It&#039;s sent.&quot; Then what will happen if you go back to publish ads and then generate 32 ads it says, &quot;Campaign and Ads have been downloaded.&quot; Now if I go to existing campaigns I will be able to find mine, so I&#039;m going to select Cold Traffic: Conversions: Auto that&#039;s the campaign I&#039;m using for this, but then I&#039;m going to select my pixel. Then I&#039;m going to select lead. Then my tracking settings I&#039;m going to make sure all three of these are selected. Then ad set prefix. This is important to do if you want things to be correctly named, which will save you so much time, and so much stress it&#039;s not even funny.


This is why we&#039;re very careful about how we name everything because it means that everything will be orderly later on because when we launch so many different variations if they don&#039;t have the right names then we can spend like days or weeks clicking on things just trying to find out what&#039;s going on. So how we name our ad set prefix is with the name or the name of our ad angle. Now I&#039;m starting off with the one angle called &quot;26-year-old punk,&quot; so I&#039;m going to write 26-year-old punk. Then it shows you here what it&#039;s going to do. It&#039;s going to name it in Facebook, so it says 26-year-old punk, and then it&#039;s going to say Fragment one, and then the name of the specific audience, which is absolutely perfect. I can&#039;t tell you how much this will change your life when you use Facebook if you name things like this, and you&#039;ll see what I mean soon when I hit publish.


Then we want to set our ad set budget to $10 per day. It should never be anything less than this. Now it&#039;s going to do some quick math for us. If we&#039;ve got eight ad sets at U.S. $10 a day total we&#039;re going to spend per day is 80. Now you&#039;ll remember here I set my budget to 1-1/2 grand. That&#039;s $150 a day. The reason why it&#039;s only showing as 80 is because I&#039;ve only launched one of my possible ad angles right now, so one times eight is eight, and then that&#039;s 80, but I&#039;m going to launch another one soon, and that&#039;s going to be another one times eight, which is 80, and then 80 plus 80 is 60, so that&#039;s 160, so that&#039;s how this all works, so you can just trust these numbers. Everything in here it adds up. It took me a long time to figure all of this stuff out.


I enter in 10 here, and then optimizing four offsite impressions, paying for impressions, max bid, automatic. Then we&#039;re going to hit generate 32 ads, boom! Then we&#039;re going to click publish 32 ads, okay? Now Qwaya will be publishing these ads to Facebook, and this can take a little bit of time. It takes a while. It&#039;s not instantaneous, but it says here, &quot;Ads cued for publication.&quot; If you click on published cue you can see, so it says right now that there&#039;s 31 ads in the cue here, and it&#039;s going through. It&#039;s publishing all of these ads as fast as it can, and you can click refresh to see how it&#039;s going, and see the progress.


Now another place to check to make sure everything is working is go to your business manager. Then launch your ad account from here your number one ad account. Then you&#039;ll see your campaigns you want to click on your Cold Traffic: Conversions: Auto. Then within here you&#039;ll start to see your different ad sets being launched. Now this is where the naming stuff comes in, and just changes the game. As you can see here it says, &quot;26-year-old punk,&quot; and then &quot;Fragment one Power of Positivity.&quot; Remember how I said that within each ad set we have a combination of one ad angle, and one audience. This is perfect because we have the naming conventions right here, so it says the ad angle 26-year-old punk. Then it says the audience, and then it even says what fragment we&#039;re going for right now. It&#039;s perfect naming.


This will change the game for you. You&#039;ll just be able to see exactly what&#039;s what in your account, and everything will be neat and tidy. Then if we drill down within any of these ad sets we&#039;ll see that there&#039;s four different images for that one angle, so it&#039;s the perfect structure. Now what I want to do is I just want to wait around until all of my ads have been published. Now this can take a little bit of time, and you just want to click Refresh to keep checking on things. Right now I&#039;ve got all eight ad sets published, which is fine. I was supposed to have eight ad sets published, but what&#039;s taken some time is the actual ads within the ad sets. You can see that I&#039;ve only got 14 ads in here so far, and if I go back to Qwaya and I hit Refresh here it says, &quot;It&#039;s got 16 ads left in the cue,&quot; right?


So it&#039;s still taking some time. You just want to keep checking the published cue on Qwaya, and you just want to keep hitting kind of refresh on your Facebook to make sure all of these things come through. Then once they&#039;ve all come through, and everything is being published you should start to see that things get approved pretty quick. You see how all of these are just getting approved pretty quick now, and they&#039;re active. This is because we pretested the ads. We pretested them before we went and launched them in volume, so I can&#039;t tell you how important that is. Now what I&#039;m going to do is I&#039;m going to launch my second ad angle because dictated by my budget here it says I get two ad angles with eight audience interests. Right now I&#039;ve launched one of these, and eight of these, but now I need to launch another one of these, and another eight of these, so I&#039;m going to go back to Qwaya.


Then I&#039;m going to click the set targeting tab, and I&#039;m going to select all, and remove selected. Then I&#039;m going to select the create ads tab, then I&#039;m going to clear creatives. Before I launched my 26-year-old punk angle to my eight audience interests now what I&#039;m going to do is launch my Nine entrepreneurs jet angle to my eight audience interests, so I&#039;m going to drag this in here, number two. You can see it&#039;s going to create one ad angle with four different images, so a total of four ads. Then I&#039;m going to click set targeting. Then I&#039;m going to drag Fragment one in here, and it&#039;s going to create eight different audiences, so it&#039;s pretty much the same process as before except this time we are just using a different ad angle.


Then we want to hit publish ads, generate 32 ads, make sure tracking settings all three of these are on. Basic settings you want to select existing campaign, dropdown, Cold Traffic: Conversions: Auto. Select your pixel. Select lead, add set prefix. This should be the name of your ad angle, and this one is called &quot;Nine Entrepreneurs Jet.&quot; Then another little hack I just remembered is to do a double space after this, and then one of those just like that, and then another double space. What this does is it will just create an even cleaner sort of naming convention here. You can see it in the example. It will say the name of the ad, then there&#039;s a line, and then the name of the audience, which is perfect. Then leave these start and end times blank, add set budget always 10 bucks. Optimize for offsite conversions, pay for impressions, max bid automatic, generate 32 ads. Then publish 32 ads, and OK.


Now we can look at our published cue here. I&#039;ll refresh it. I&#039;ll just wait for these things to move out of the way. Maybe it won&#039;t move out of the way. Refresh the screen. Now it&#039;s gone. It says that there is 28 left in cue, 27 left in cue, so we can click on our published cue, and keep refreshing to see how it&#039;s going. 26 left in cue. Now what we can also do is click business manager, and then launch our ad account from here. We can look within our Cold Traffic: Conversions: Auto Campaign at our ad set. We had eight ad sets before. Now we&#039;ve got 16, which is perfect. You can see eight are called 26-year-old punk, and another eight are called Nine Entrepreneurs Jet, and they&#039;re created for each one of these different audience interests here. Perfect.


Then if I click on ads for one campaign I&#039;ve got a total of 42 ads, but by the time it&#039;s done there should be 60 ads in here. If I go back to Qwaya and I refresh this now it&#039;s got 22 left. So you just want to sit patiently until this published cue here gets down to zero and it&#039;s complete, and until you refresh this, and you have all of your ad sets, and all of your ads published. It will take a little bit of time, but building it with Qwaya is so much faster than building it manually it&#039;s not even funny. Most people wouldn&#039;t even know how to actually build this campaign manually because you can see how painful it would be. You&#039;ve got to get all of these names right. You&#039;ve got to get all of these different things right, but with Qwaya it builds it effortlessly.


We&#039;ve got the absolute perfect balance and harmony of ad angles to audience interests as the highest possible combinations that we can possibly have given our specific budget, so this is the definition of like the perfect Facebook campaign. We just wait until this goes down. I&#039;m just going to assume this is all done now, but you would wait until yours is actually all done. Now we have just finished with step five, and we&#039;ve even finished step six, which is select Cold Traffic: Conversions: Auto. Set everything up. All right, so we&#039;re done with all of that. Now for the next step.


Campaign Genesis: Let there be traffic, clicks and light. We&#039;re going to check for campaign life. Number one. Now that your Facebook ads should be publishing from Qwaya into Facebook, or they should already be published from Qwaya into Facebook this may take some time, and you want to jump into your Facebook ads manager account to check on the status of the upload process. Step two. Keep watching your ads upload until everything is launched successfully. Then step three. Once it&#039;s launched successfully keep watching until you start to see some campaign life, which is things like impressions, clicks, and money being spent, et cetera. Now that our ads are live we want to check in our ads manager. We can go through Business.Facebook.com. Then launch this. Then we want to look at our specific campaign.


We want to start to see some sort of sign of life going on here. Right now my reach is all zero. While these are approved, which is good, and they&#039;re active, which is good, none of them have received any reach or anything yet, so we&#039;re waiting to see something like dollars spent, or we&#039;re waiting to see something like reach, or link clicks, something like this. This is what we call &quot;signs of life.&quot; Now it can often take a little bit of time for this sort of information to show on the screen. Now it can take anywhere from a few minutes, but sometimes it can take a few hours. The main thing is to make sure all your ads are approved, they&#039;re all published in here, and then it depends on how old your ad account is. If it&#039;s brand new it might take a while for Facebook to start serving you some traffic, but eventually you will start getting some traffic here. Then once you can see just any sort of sign of life here then you know you&#039;re good, and we can go to the next step in the process.


Step three. It says we could seen some impressions, some clicks, or a little bit of money being spent. It doesn&#039;t have to be a huge amount just something that shows that things are working successfully. If things aren&#039;t working after 24 hours then you need to contact Facebook, and see what&#039;s going on, but you should always see some signs of life within 24 hours. Now step four. Once you can see some campaign life it&#039;s time to leave your blue swan DNA variants in the Garden of Eden for an incubation period of four days. I know it&#039;s tempting. This is where everyone messes it up.


They launched their ads, and then they can see that they&#039;re approved and everything. They can see some signs of life, and then they just want to go in and tinker with stuff. That is the last thing you want to do. You have to leave things for an incubation period of four days. It&#039;s like when babies are first born a lot of the time they have to go into like an incubator because they&#039;re not ready immediately to face like the environment. This is a similar sort of thing. These initial conditions are so crucial to the evolution of these swans that we have planted here that we need to keep our hands off. No tinkering at all. We&#039;ve got to leave it for a period of four days, and I can&#039;t tell you how important this is.


Step five. We can check back once every 24 hours, but we must keep our hands out of the Garden of Eden until the fourth day when the four-day incubation period is complete. Don&#039;t touch a single thing in your campaign until this is over. Anything you do or change will infect the initial conditions, and spoil the entire experiment, so keep your hands off. I&#039;m deadly serious about this. Don&#039;t touch anything. Even if an ad looks like it&#039;s not working don&#039;t touch it. Even if an ad looks like it&#039;s working don&#039;t touch it.


You have to keep your hands off for a full four days. When you come in every 24 hours just to look at things all you&#039;re really doing is making sure that it hasn&#039;t done something crazy like spent more than what you thought it was going to spend, so we&#039;re really just making sure that it&#039;s not overspending, and if it&#039;s not overspending then we just leave it. Hands off for four days. If you touch it all the work you will have done up until this point is spoiled. Be honest with yourself. Don&#039;t mess with it. If you do then it&#039;s not going to work.


Congratulations on launching your campaign. I know it&#039;s been a long process, and it&#039;s been a lot of work, but if you followed all of these steps then you have launched a campaign successfully like the absolute top advertisers in the entire world. You are now at the forefront of Facebook advertising. We will be checking for blue swans and red swans after the incubation period of four days is complete. Until then remember to keep your hands out of the Garden of Eden. Congratulations on setting this all up.


Now what I mean by checking for swans is after four days of incubation we&#039;re going to come in here, and we&#039;re going to start looking at all of these numbers. We&#039;re going to start determining, which ones are red swans, which ones are blue swans, and all of that. A blue swan is a profitable ad set. A red swan is a non-profitable ad set, and it&#039;s outside of KPI, so we cannot do any sort of determinate. We can&#039;t determine whether a swan is red or blue until it&#039;s had four days of incubation. Even if you think you&#039;re really smart, and you think that you can see that one is red on day one you can&#039;t make a judgment call until the fourth day.


I&#039;ve see ad sets that start off bad, and by the fourth day they&#039;re the best. Things change around so much in those first four days that you just have to keep your hands off. You have let all of the different DNA structures fight it out, survival of the fittest, and see on the fourth day, which ones are winners and, which ones are losers, but until the fourth day none of this data in here means anything, so until then remember to keep your hands out of the Garden of Eden. Thanks for watching this training module. Congratulations on launching your campaign, and I&#039;ll see you in the next training module right now.
