                        Hey everyone, Sam Ovens here and welcome to this training module called Governing Initial Conditions. So, in this module I&#039;m going to explain what to do after you&#039;ve launched your ads and you&#039;ve left them for four days. Those four days are crucial. It&#039;s like the incubation period for the ads and you have to keep your hands off them during that time. Then on the fourth day, we come in and we look at what&#039;s happened, and that&#039;s when we start to identify blue swans and red swans, and we start to make all of our changes and everything and report all of that data. So, this is an extremely important module and it&#039;s really where we get to measure whether our stuff has worked or not and what to do about it if it hasn&#039;t and what do about it if it has, like how to really scale things up.

So, let&#039;s get right to it. So, here&#039;s what we&#039;re going to cover in today&#039;s training. We&#039;re going to start off with keeping your hands out of Eden and this is a four-day no touch rule and this is vital. I&#039;m going to explain why it&#039;s vital and how if you really mess this up or if you don&#039;t take this advice, nothing you do on Facebook is going to be worth anything. Then we&#039;re going to discuss our judgment day pre-check. This is a pre-check, which we do before the official judgment day. This pre-check is basically to check that our ads and our funnel is in order. So, we want to make sure that everything is working properly. Our ads are getting clicks, and impressions and all of that, and we want someone to make sure that our funnel is in order and that&#039;s working.

Then official judgment day, and this is day four after we&#039;ve done our pre-check, and this is when we use our KPIs to determine the faith of swans. So, depending on the KPI&#039;s of all different ads sets, we&#039;re going to judge them on that fourth day over a period of four days and we&#039;re going to see what ones are red swans and what ones are blue swans, and we&#039;re going to judge them, and then we&#039;re going to [call 00:02:18] the red ones, and we&#039;re basically going to do a big cleanup.

Finally, judgment day aftermath. This is after we have done our big cleanup and at this stage, we really need to determine whether we need to add more swan DNA variation if necessary. So, sometimes after you&#039;ve gone through and you&#039;ve done a big purging of everything, and you&#039;ve gotten rid of all of the red swans, sometimes you have enough blue swans left that you can propagate them, and then you&#039;re good to go and you can hit your target. But sometimes, you have hardly any blue swans left and you really need to add some new DNA variation back into Eden for testing.

So, I&#039;m going to take you through all of these vital steps in this module today, and I&#039;m going to show you how it works, the different rules, the different workflows, and I&#039;m even going to show you on my screen, I launched some live Facebook ads to our funnel last night, and so I&#039;ve got some real data in my Facebook account and I&#039;m going to go through that and show you really step by step on my screen how to do it, so there should be no gray areas.

At this stage of the Facebook training, you should have launched your Facebook campaigns, and they should have signs of life and by signs of life I mean they should be getting reach, they should be getting impressions, and clicks. Once your campaigns show signs of life, you want to leave them for a full four days. This is vital and this is what we call keeping your hands of Eden and this is our four-day no touch rule.

So, as soon as you launch your Facebook ads, and get them approved, and see signs of life by observing things like impressions, reach, and clicks. You want to leave your campaigns alone. Do not touch it for four entire days. This is so important. If you come back and touch anything in here, you&#039;re going to spoil the experiment. You&#039;re going to infect it. It&#039;s not going to show any accurate data.

You can come back to your ads account every 24 hours just to make sure that you didn&#039;t make a mistake and that the ads aren&#039;t running or are spending more budget that you had anticipated. So, it&#039;s a good idea to come back every 24 hours, log in and just check. I mean, one thing we want to check is that we&#039;re actually getting traffic. Like it&#039;s not like it&#039;s been 24 hours and we don&#039;t have any clicks. That would be an issue that&#039;s why we want to check every 24.

Another issue that can happen is if you set the budgets wrong. Now, you shouldn&#039;t have done that because these instructions are very thorough and we take you through every step, so it shouldn&#039;t have happened if you followed the instructions. However, if you haven&#039;t followed the instructions, then this is a good reason to come back and check every 24 hours. We don&#039;t want you spending more than you thought you were going to spend. Then, that&#039;s all that&#039;s the only reason why we&#039;re coming in to check. We&#039;re just checking for any sort of emergencies. We don&#039;t want to judge the ads yet. We don&#039;t want to judge the ads or the campaigns in any way, shape or form, and we don&#039;t want to touch or change a single thing. We want to just leave it as is.

These initial four days are extremely important and they&#039;re like an incubation period for your ads to interact with the environment and evolve. Ads can look bad in day one and they can be your best ads by day four. Honestly, whatever you do, don&#039;t touch them. You can see ad sets which look like blue swans in day one and then by day four, they&#039;re red swans and you can see red swans in day one but by day four, they&#039;re your best blue swans. So, there&#039;s a lot of stuff going on in these initial four days and that&#039;s why we really need to keep our hands off, and not go in there, and touch anything. We need to let this incubation period play out so that the different combinations can really interact with the environment and evolve and that&#039;s how we can find what are the good ones, what are the bad ones. This is crucial.

If you do touch your ads account in any way, shape or form during these four days, you have spoiled the experiment and whatever you think you observer is nothing but false information and you must start over. So, be honest with yourself. If you do go in and tinkle with stuff within the four-day period, all you have to do is flush everything out. You just have to delete everything you did and whatever money you spent doesn&#039;t matter, whatever results you think you got doesn&#039;t matter. You got to flush it out. You have to let this four-day period play out.

You just want to sit tight for four days and let your campaign run its course for four days. It should be spending close to the daily budget you allocated, which is at least $151. Sometimes it will spend a little bit over like $160 or $155, that&#039;s totally fine, and sometimes it will spend like $140 or something. But if it&#039;s only spending like 20 bucks or something, then that could be an issue. But it should be spending close to this number of $151 or whatever you set yours for depending on your testing budget.

Now, we&#039;re going to discuss judgment day pre-check and checking that our ads and funnel are in order. So, judgment day is what we call the fourth day of testing because it&#039;s when we can determine the true nature of the campaign and ad sets, and it takes a full four days for the algorithm to optimize and iterate between variables, and it also takes four days worth of time, impressions, clicks, and actions to determine the true KPI numbers since there are ebbs and flows day-to-day as well as regression to the mean. No KPI is a KPI till the fourth day and this is so important. You do not have a KPI on day one. You have a random number. You don&#039;t have a KPI on day two, you don&#039;t have a KPI on day three. KPIs only become KPIs after four days because if you&#039;re looking into day, if you&#039;re looking at the isolated days, there&#039;s going to be so much variance between the different days that, you know, you&#039;re just reporting in false information. You have to let the four days play out.

You know, there&#039;s ebbs and flows and what that means is that things can swing really like 100% day-to-day. Like if I was running Facebook ads and I was scaled up, one day I might make $51,000 a day. The next day I might make $100,000 a day and then back to 51 and then back to 100, back to 51, back to 100. You know, that&#039;s just how it works. That&#039;s just the regression to the mean revealing itself and playing out. So, this is why it&#039;s so important to not isolate individual days because numbers don&#039;t behave that way and if you start judging things and start panicking or trying to change things around based on what you see day to day, you&#039;re going to ruin your whole campaign and just make a big mess. So, really remember this one: no KPI is a KPI till the fourth day.

Number two, you want to set up your Facebook ads manager so that you can see the right reporting columns and these are delivery, amount, reach, link clicks, CTR link, CPC link, value video opt-ins, cost per value video opt-in, survey applications, cost per survey applications, and then your relevance score. So, by default, Facebook shows you these random columns that really don&#039;t make any sense and you don&#039;t really know what&#039;s going on. I&#039;m going to show you how to set this up right now.

So, you want to go to your Facebook business manager, select your number one ad account. I&#039;m just using my number three ad account here for demo purposes. You&#039;ll have your campaign here and it&#039;s called traffic conversions order. Now, I set this up last night and let it run so it hasn&#039;t had four days. So, when I&#039;m showing you this, it hasn&#039;t had a full four days. It hasn&#039;t even had a full 24 hours because my daily budget is $151 just as recommended and, you know, it&#039;s only spent really half of that. So, I could have waited a full four days, but this training would have been delayed. So, I&#039;m showing you this without even having 24 hours so just keep that in mind as I take you through this demonstration. But I am using the same funnel I recommend in this program, and the same ads, and everything. So, I set this up. Same budget, same everything. I set this up so it could be at true demonstration of what I&#039;ve recommended for you to do.

So, what you want to do is you want to go to your adset level here, and then you want to click on columns, and you want to click on customized columns. This is where you get to really customize your columns. So, we&#039;re going to go and we&#039;re going to get rid of all these to start with just like that and now we&#039;re going to follow what our instruction say. So, delivery, amount, reach, and link clicks. So, delivery, amount, reach, and link clicks. So, delivery ... we&#039;ll make sure we got it in order. It should be in this order: delivery, amount, reach, and link clicks. Delivery, amount, reach, and link clicks, CTR link, CPC link.

So, we want to go CTR link and then we want to go ... what was the next one? CPC link then value of the opt-ins. So, CPC link click. It&#039;s important that we use the link click ones because this means real link click on our links, otherwise, if you just click on normal clicks, if you just select normal clicks, if someone likes your ad or comments or something, Facebook counts that as a click. So, that&#039;s not really useful to you. You only want to know people who actually come and visit your landing page, real clicks, so that&#039;s why we use link click. That&#039;s the best metric to use.

Then we had value video opt-ins and cost per value video opt-in. So, value video opt-ins. Cost per value video opt-in. Then what was next? We had survey applications and cost per survey application. So, survey application, cost per survey application and then the final one was relevance score. So, it should look like this: adset name, delivery, amount spent, reach, relevance score, link clicks, CPC link click, CTR link click, survey applications, value video opt-ins, cost per survey application, cost per value video opt-ins. Then attribution window, you can leave that on a 28-day, a 1-day view, and then you want to go apply.

Now, when you look at your columns, they&#039;re going to look like this and it&#039;s much easier for us to tell what&#039;s going on. Now, what we want to do is we want to click on this and then we want to click save. Then we want to type in here ... what&#039;s a good name for this one? I would just call this funnel tracking or I&#039;ll call this official tracking. Save. So, official tracking. So, now whenever you go and check your Facebook account, you always want to make sure you select official tracking here and it will have saved this template for these columns. These are the columns you should be looking at, not the normal ones that Facebook provides. So, once we&#039;ve set that up, awesome.

Now, the next one. Step three. You want to isolate the date for the first day of your campaign and report the metrics from Facebook to your paid attraction metrics spreadsheet. Then you want to start with the first day, then the second, then the third, then the fourth and report all metrics using real data. So, I&#039;m going to tell you what this means in just a second. So, when we&#039;re doing this, you want to isolate the first day of your four days. So, you&#039;ll do this up here. You click on this date range and then let&#039;s say that I launched mine yesterday, on the 11th. I&#039;ll be going just 11th to the 11th and then I go update.

Now, provided it&#039;s not the 11th, you&#039;re always reporting on yesterday&#039;s data so we have to wait for a full four days to play out. We have to wait for the full 96 hours before we really check because we have to wait until all the official data is in. You never report on today&#039;s data because today isn&#039;t over. You always want to report on yesterday&#039;s data and the morning is the best time to do that because even at midnight, it still takes a while for Facebook to really populate and aggregate all of the data, so it&#039;s best to do it the morning after.

So, once you isolate that first day, now what you want to do is report these numbers into your paid client attraction metrics or paid attraction metric spreadsheet and you&#039;ll see you&#039;ve got the performance dashboard on the first step, then you can go into month one and there is a demo line here that shows you what to enter. But I&#039;m going to go ahead and what you want to do is you just want to delete out these white ones and leave the gray ones like that.

Now, I&#039;m going to tell you where to get all of this data from. So, you&#039;ll notice I said isolate the day for the first day of your campaign and then report the metrics from Facebook into your spreadsheet. You want to start with the first day, then the second, then the third, then fourth and you want to report all metrics using something called real data. So, what is real data? I&#039;m going to explain that right now. So, reporting on real Facebook and funnel metrics. When reporting data into your paid attraction metric spreadsheet, you want to make sure that you&#039;re using real data and not just relying on the data Facebook shows you in the ads manager reporting columns.

So, back here, if we look at these reporting columns sometimes the starter is accurate, but sometimes the starter is inna curate and that&#039;s just the nature of Facebook tracking. You know, Facebook tracking uses pixels and pixels aren&#039;t really the best. There are better forms of tracking for some things. So, this is what I mean by reporting on real Facebook and funnel metrics. So, I&#039;ve listed all of our KPIs here, every single one, and I&#039;ve told you where you get it from and the ones highlighted in red are the unique KPIs that we get from places other than Facebook. So, with ads spent, Facebook is obviously pretty good at calculating how much money that we spent. It&#039;s very accurate on that one.

So, we always get adspend from Facebook. Impressions we get from Facebook. CPM, which is cost per 1,000 impressions. This spreadsheet auto calculates it for you. So here, you&#039;d plug in your adspend, then you plug in your impressions, and then CPM would auto calculate. All the gray columns have in-built functions in them so that they auto calculate, it saves you a whole bunch of time, and all the formulas already created. So, you just plug in adspend and impressions and then it will tell you CPM, right?

Then relevance. You get from this from Facebook by downloading to Excel. So, you can actually get the relevance average from within Facebook and I&#039;m going to show you how to do that in just a second. Then for tracking clicks, you wants to use Bitly.com to attract. So, if you go Bitly.com, you can create a free account and when you&#039;re logged in it will look like this. What you basically do that you&#039;d click on create Bit link. You would Trace to URL in here, which could be like samovensdemo.com/casestudy. I could plug this in, click create. Then you want to give it a title, so you know I could call it Fragmentation Funnel FB Ads. I&#039;m just going to put in brackets to here because this is the second one I&#039;ve created. Then it gives you a proper Bitly, and then you can eat it if you want to, and then you can go save and it creates a Bitly link.

Here is a link which I can use and if I click on copy, it will copy this link to my clipboard. Then if I go to this link here, you see how it takes me to my landing page? So, it&#039;s like there was a link before it took me to my landing page. You&#039;re probably thinking, &quot;Well, why do we want to do that? Wouldn&#039;t it be best just to drop the exact link in?&quot; Well, the reason why want to do this is because we can track true clicks. We want to make sure that the data we&#039;re observing is truly in Facebook. We want to sort of correlate it to something else. You know, when Facebook is saying we&#039;re getting 100 clicks, but Bitly is saying we only got 51, then we know something is up. Also, Bitly will tell you where, you know, most of these people are based. So, we can tell if we&#039;re getting bots or we can tell if we&#039;re getting spam traffic or something like that. So, this is a very accurate link click tracker.

Then all you do is you select from the date range up here and you could select the specific day, for example, the 11th. I can&#039;t do this today because this is brand new link. So, you know, you&#039;d select yesterday and then you&#039;d go apply and it would show you how many people had clicked on this link and what the different time distribution was. So, this is a good free tool to use when it comes to tracking links and what you want to do when you create your ads is you want to put the Bitly link inside your Facebook ads instead of your actual link.

Now, if you&#039;ve already gone and launched your ads just using the normal link, then that&#039;s totally fine. Don&#039;t stress about it. You don&#039;t need to go and change it. But in the future, when you go to launch ads, you should try to use a Bitly link. Then for click through rate, the spreadsheet auto calculates this for you. Then for CPC, spreadsheet auto calculates. Then for leads, you can get this directly from your CRM, which will be ActiveCampaign if you&#039;re set up using our methods.

So, instead of relying on ... you know, I could go into here and this will tell me how many link clicks I got, it will say 21. Then my CPC link click it&#039;s saying it&#039;s 3 bucks. Then my CTR it&#039;s saying that it&#039;s 0.67%. Then value video opt-ins, it&#039;s saying I got 13 total and I&#039;m paying $4.85 per value video opt-in. But what I want to do is really check to make sure that these numbers are accurate. Like did you really get 13 value video opt-ins? So, that&#039;s what you can find from ActiveCampaign. So, you&#039;d log into that. You&#039;d log into ActiveCampaign and then you want to look at your lists.

Now, I created the server applications and the value video opt-ins when I was creating the training. But then to do this experiment with Facebook just over the past sort of 18 hours or whatever it&#039;s been, I used survey applications 2 and value video opt-ins 2. You won&#039;t have these ones. You&#039;ll just have these and that&#039;s totally fine. So, I&#039;m just going to look at value video opt-ins 2 and I&#039;m going to see how many different context I&#039;ve got in here.

So, you know, it&#039;s saying that I have, in total, really only nine context and if I go back to Facebook here, see it&#039;s reporting that I have 13. So, it&#039;s off by a little bit and sometimes this happens because what can happen is someone might opt-in for something and then they might go away and then they might go and do it again. If someone does it twice, that&#039;s going to really count as, you know, more opt-ins. So, this is exactly why we use real data and not just the data Facebook tells us and it&#039;s all right if there&#039;s a discrepancy between the two, it&#039;s totally normal, and this is why we report on this.

So, I would grab in here ... I would look at the context I got within a specific date range and then what I would do is I would add those in here under ... where would I add it? Into number of leads. Then this gray columns like CTR, CPC, LPC, CPL, this will all calculate automatically. Then spreadsheet auto calculates LPC and CPL, then for surveys you want to get this directly from your CRM as well. So, just like I did with value video opt-ins, you go to lists and then you&#039;d click on survey applications. Then in here you should be able to see. So, I don&#039;t have any survey applications so far, which is understandable. I mean, I only had nine people actually opt-in for my value video. So, zero out of nine is normal and the reason why my data looks like this is I haven&#039;t even waited 24 hours and you guys will be doing this after four days, so it should be a different story for you.

Then what I&#039;m going to do is I&#039;m going to go back to instructions. Then for VCR, which is your spread ... the spreadsheet will auto calculate this for you. This is your video conversion rate. Then for cost per strategy session, the spreadsheet will auto calculate this for you as well. Then for the number of calls, well you should get this from your call recordings or your notes. I mean, you should have notes of the calls you did or you should have the recordings from them or they should be in your calendar. You know, you should know how many calls you actually did and this is a number that you input manually.

Then how many sales did you make? What&#039;s the number of sales made? Well, you can get this from Stripe or your notes. You should know how many sales you made. If you&#039;re using Stripe and pay funnels like we recommend, well you could go and look in there, or you probably have some notes of who signed up. You can input it there. Then sales dollars. You can get this from Stripe or your notes as well. You know, these are two things you definitely should be aware of. Then call conversion rate, the spreadsheet will auto calculate. Cost per acquisition, spreadsheet will auto calculate. Profit and loss, auto calculates. ROI, auto calculates and ROI four-day moving average, auto calculates.

So, you don&#039;t really have to get that much information yourself. So, if we go back here and it says isolate the first and then report all of this data using real data. So, we&#039;ll go ahead and we&#039;ll do that right now so you can see first-hand how it&#039;s done. So, you want to select the first day, let&#039;s say that is the 11th. You update your numbers and now, the first one we want to report on is adspend. So, we look at the bottom of the column and it says $6,307. So, adspend, $6,307.

Then it&#039;s saying impressions. So, what I&#039;m going to do is I&#039;m going to just add to our official tracking, I&#039;m going to add impressions. So, we should put impressions just before reach here and you should update that, then you should click on apply. Then you should go here and you should save and you want to save this as official tracking, then replace. So, now we have updated our official tracking sheet. So, here I can see my total impressions for yesterday and it is 3,122. So, I come in here. Impressions, 3,122.

Now, for relevance score. So, to get relevance score, I&#039;ll show you how to do that right now. So, you&#039;ll go to your ads manager and to do it, you want to make sure that you&#039;ve selected your specific campaign, like a cold traffic one, then you want to drill down to the ads level here. It&#039;s calculating and you can see relevance only really calculates at the ad level. You won&#039;t see it at the adset level and you won&#039;t see it at the campaign level. You&#039;ll only see it at the ad level and you know, none of these ads have actually had enough time to really even gain a relevance score, but over four days they will.

So, what I&#039;m going to do is I&#039;m just going to change this time window here and just see if I can see any relevance scores. Still nothing really. So, it&#039;s all right. In yours, you should be able to see something. So, what you want to do is to see these, you want to make sure you&#039;ve isolated the day, like the 11th, and then you want to go export. Click on export. Save as, you can just go save as XLS. Export then it will calculate. You can see it&#039;s downloading here. Then what you do is you open up this using Excel and then what we&#039;re looking for is relevance score here. All we&#039;re doing to calculate relevance is we want to go average. So, equals AV, select average. Then we want to select the range, which is from this one all the way down to this one, enter. If there were numbers in here, it would tell us what the average for that date was.

So, I&#039;m just going to plug in a couple of numbers like ... because the relevance score will be in between 1 and 10. Now, if I go down, we can see that my average relevance is 4.35, right? Now, if you don&#039;t have any relevance numbers here and it&#039;s just giving you an error, well what you&#039;d report in your paid attraction metrics spreadsheet is just like nothing. Just do a little dash like that because we don&#039;t have the data yet. We don&#039;t write zero because that&#039;s not really accurate or if you got an average of 4.35, you&#039;d put 4.35, all right?

If I forward this first day, I&#039;m just going to assume I got 4.35. If yours is just a dash, that&#039;s fine. Nothing to worry about. Now, what we&#039;re going to do is go back. That&#039;s all we need to do to get the relevance score and we can get that by just exporting. We have to export each day and average that column for relevance score from the ad level. Then we&#039;re going to exit that. Then you can just delete that file. I&#039;m mean, there&#039;s absolutely no need to really hang onto it. I mean, you can just get rid of it once we&#039;ve reported it.

Now, the next one to get is clicks and as you can see here, clicks we use Bitly to track. So, we would go into our Bitly account and then we would select the date range. So, if it was just like, you know, the 11th, then we&#039;d go apply and we would see how many links are actual clicks we got and we would report using this number here. I wasn&#039;t using Bitly for this test, so apologies that I&#039;m not able to show you in this demo. But let&#039;s just assume that I was and our ads manager here is telling us that yesterday we got a total of 21 link clicks. So, I&#039;m just going to assume that&#039;s correct, so I&#039;d put in 21. Now, you can see it&#039;s auto calculated CPM, CTR, and CPC.

Now, it needs number of leads and you can see from our instruction we get this directly from our CRM, so if I go in here, ActiveCampaign, I go to my lists and then I select my value video opt-ins. I can see that I&#039;ve got a total of nine. Now, you really want to sort by the date range to find out which ones you got on which particular day and then you want to go to Facebook and see how that correlates.

So, ActiveCampaign said I got nine and I can see nine actual emails. Facebook says I got 13 but, I mean, I don&#039;t have 13 emails. So, which one would you rather trust, the one where you can&#039;t see the emails or the one where you can? You&#039;d choose the one where you can. So, we use the real number. So, now this is showing me that my landing page conversion so far is 43%, which is very high. Do not be alarmed if yours is not that high. It won&#039;t be. Then my cost per lead is $7.01. That&#039;s all right. It&#039;s actually for a landing page conversion that high, it&#039;s not that great. You can see I&#039;m paying $3 per link click here and my landing conversion is 43, my cost per lead is 7 bucks.

So, the next one is surveys. If we go to our chart here, our table, it says surveys: get directly from your CRM, ActiveCampaign. So, if we go to ActiveCampaign then we go to lists. We would go to survey applications and then in here, you should be able to see how many you have. Now, I don&#039;t have any, so I&#039;m going to put zero. Then it&#039;s going to say your video conversation rate. Obviously, this can&#039;t calculate until we at least have a survey like if I put one here, it would tell me, but right now it&#039;s still zero. That&#039;s why that&#039;s like that also, that why cost per survey is like that. If there was one survey, it would tell us what that figure was. So, I&#039;m just going to put in zero. You can just leave this there.

Then calls. Well, you should know how many actual sale calls you did. Obviously, I&#039;ve done zero because I had zero surveys, so I&#039;m going to put zero. Then it will tell you, you know, your cost per strategy session and everything. If I put one in there, let&#039;s say cost per strategy session would be 63% or if I had one survey, then my show-up rate would be 100% because I have one survey and then one call. So, this is how it works.

Then sales number. You&#039;d put in the number of sales you closed. Now, for me today, zero. Sales revenue, you put in zero. If we refer back to our table here, sales, we pull this from Stripe or our notes and sales revenue number we get this from Stripe or our notes. Then this will calculate everything for us like our cost per acquisition, our profit or loss, and our ROI, and all of this. So, right now you can see my loss for the day is just 63 bucks, so I&#039;m down 63 bucks. Now, this number here doesn&#039;t make any sense until you get like four days with the data. So, that&#039;s how that works.

Now, what I&#039;m going to do is go back to my instructions here. Step three was isolate the first day and report on that data. Now, after you report on the first day then you want to do the second day, the third day, and then the fourth day. So, if I go back to our ads manager here and I&#039;m looking within this campaign, and I see all of the stuff in here, I would be reporting on the first day, then I would select day, then third day, then the fourth day, then I&#039;d update it.

Now, because I don&#039;t have enough data here, what I&#039;m going to do is I&#039;m just going to make this up. So, imagine I spent $151, I got 7,000. My relevance was like 4.35. Then my clicks, let&#039;s assume that I got ... if I spent pretty much, we&#039;d go 45. Then what you can do is you can select these and just drag them down to total these things. You select, drag down and that will total everything up for you.

All right, now if we&#039;ve only got four days of data, then it should just look like this or if I just go like this, I&#039;m just making these things up here. You can see how this all works. So, I got to zero then this day I had two, then one, then three, and then sales let&#039;s just say I had zero sales or just let&#039;s say I had one sale through here and I made no money except from the fourth day and then here I made a sale for $2,000. Now, I just made this stuff up here just so you can see what it would look like, but it would look something like this.

Now, you can see where your CPM is trending, where your CPR is trending, CPC, landing page conversion, all of that stuff. Then you&#039;re going to get numbers based on your four-day ROI moving average and really, with these numbers, you don&#039;t want to look at the individual days. You&#039;re more interested in how they average over four days for everything. Then once you see your numbers here and you&#039;ve reported on your first four days, then we go back to instructions and then step four.

Now, compare your KPI&#039;s to the student benchmark KPI&#039;s available on the dashboard tab. How do your numbers compare to the benchmarks? Where are you in KPI? Where are you out of KPI? So, what we do is we just click on performance dashboard here. Now, these are the student benchmarks and now these are your numbers here. So, on a lot of these things, we don&#039;t really have the right numbers yet. So, that&#039;s fine. We need to probably complete more data in here or we can see down here there are some errors here. That&#039;s probably because of this. Let&#039;s remove that. That fixes that. If I remove this, then it will fix that one. Yeah, so we just have to fix these. We just have to put zeros in here to fix this up and then that will work like that.

Now, if we look down here, these ones, cost per survey, those things you&#039;ll have to fix up if that issues happens to you. Now, if you look down the bottom of the total, so all of these are fine. So, now if we go back to our performance dashboard, all of our data is in here. So, what were really want to do is we want to compare our data here to this data up here. So, right now, if I look at my relevance, I&#039;m a little bit below.

If I look at my click through rate, I&#039;m okay. My landing page conversion rate, this one is not calculating correctly, so you&#039;d want to fix that, but if I go back to here, month one, if I look at my landing page conversion, it looks like it&#039;s .... so, what we really need to do here is we want to look at this formula and it should just be average. So, just click on average. Boom! Now, that&#039;s going to give us the right data. So, my landing page conversion, 45. I&#039;m doing really well here. Then video conversion rate, this is really high, but obviously, this is fake data which I just plugged in.

Then call show up rate, looking all right there. Then call conversion rate I&#039;m a bit low on that. Then cost per impressions, I&#039;m pretty much fine there. I&#039;m just a little bit out of KPI. Cost per click, I&#039;m just a little bit out on that too, which isn&#039;t too bad. Cost per lead, I&#039;m fine here. Then cost per survey, fine here. Cost per call, fine. Cost per acquisition, we&#039;ll I&#039;m doing really good because, obviously, these numbers are made up. If you didn&#039;t get a sale within the first four days, that&#039;s absolutely fine because most people don&#039;t get a sale within the first four days. We&#039;re just trying to really test these other metrics here, but this is just demonstration to give you an idea of how this work.

So, if we go back to our instructions, we&#039;ve looked at step four. Where are you in KPI? Where are you out of KPI? Now, we can go to step five. If your numbers are within the student KPI benchmark range, then you can proceed to the next step. If your numbers are outside of the KPI benchmark range, then you want to to refer to the troubleshooting Facebook ads cheat sheet.

Now, you know how some of mine were just a little bit out, like 21. That&#039;s so negligible, you wouldn&#039;t even worry about it. Then $3.25, don&#039;t worry about it. When I say out, you&#039;re really looking for something that&#039;s quite far out because sometimes, you&#039;ll have things that are way in an it gives you room to have something that&#039;s a little bit out. But if you&#039;re way out, then that&#039;s a cause for concern and you want to have a look. So, don&#039;t be too picky with the stuff here.

Now, if we go back to our instructions, if you are out of KPI, like way out, then you want to refer to our troubleshooting Facebook ads cheat sheet and I&#039;ll pull that up right now. So, this is a PDF available for download beneath this video in the resources section and it&#039;s a cheat sheet that basically shows you how to trouble shoot every possible thing with your Facebook ads. So, the introduction says use this cheat sheet to troubleshoot issues with Facebook ads and funnels. Before consulting this cheat sheet, you should have completed all modules in Week Five - Fractal Facebook Evolution. If you haven&#039;t followed our process/methodology step by step, then this cheat sheet is going to be of little to no value. Make sure you follow this process step by step and then refer to this cheat sheet after four days of live testing with your campaign and then work through this process sequentially to identify your issue and fix it.

So, we can start off here with all of these different things. In the bold it says what the issue is and then here we&#039;ve given the answer. So, if your Facebook ads are not getting approved, if your Facebook ads are getting disapproved, make sure that you watch the module in week five&#039;s Facebook training titled Facebook&#039;s Book of Law. Watch that video in full to ensure you&#039;re following all the rules. If you are following the rules, then check why your Facebook ads were disapproved within the Facebook platform. They will give a reason, delete the disapproved adsets.

So, you see, I&#039;ve given you step by step instructions for every possible thing that could happen like my Facebook ads are not receiving any impressions. Well, here&#039;s what to do. My KPIs are outside of the student benchmark range. Well, here&#039;s what to do. Then we drill down into the different KPIs. So, my Facebook ads are not receiving any clicks. Here&#039;s what to do. My Facebook ads are not spending anywhere near the daily budget I set for them. Well, here&#039;s what to do. My cost per click, also known as CPC, on Facebook is out of KPI. Well, here&#039;s how to fix it. If your CPC is too high, well here&#039;s how you get it fixed.

My click through rate or CTR on Facebook is out of KPI. My relevance score on Facebook is out KPI. My cost per 1K impressions, also known as CPM, on Facebook is out of KPI. My cost per lead is out of KPI. My cost for survey application or video conversion rate, CPS or VCR, is out of KPI. My call show-up rate, also known as SUR, is out of KPI or my call conversion rate, CCR, is outside of KPI. My cost pre-requisition, CPA, is outside of KPI and my return on investment, ROI, is outside of KPI.

So, you can see, you know this is like a seven-page document that&#039;s pretty intense. I mean, I take you through every possible scenario here. For every single arrow, for every single metric which we have on this entire sheet here, every single metric from here all the way across, I have covered it in detail here. So, if you have an issue with any metric, I know what the problem is and all you need to do is refer to this cheat sheet, find your problem, and then follow the instructions to fix it.

You can see here, I spent a lot of time doing this, I just mapped out every possible tangent and path that someone could go through and, you know, put in different parameters and mapped it all out, so that you know exactly what to do at each stage regardless of what happens. So, this is going to be an invaluable resource for everyone to refer back to and troubleshoot your ads, and funnels, and campaigns, and everything. It not only helps you identify the problem, but then it helps you understand why the problem exists and then it tells you step by step how to fix the problem. So, it&#039;s everything you really need here.

So, back to our instructions, that is Step 5. If you&#039;re outside of KPI when you&#039;re doing your judgment day project, then refer to the troubleshooting Facebook ads cheat sheet and you need to fix stuff there. You aren&#039;t ready to proceed through to the actual judgment day itself. Here is a slide, you know, just talking about where we get all of this real data from and I walked you through to each one of these before. So, now it&#039;s time for the day, judgment day. This is where we use KPIs to determine the fate of swans. So first up, step 1, now it&#039;s time for us to use our KPIs to determine where the ad sets the red swans or blue swans.

So what you want to do is step 2, load your Facebook ads manager and have your paid attraction metrics spreadsheet handy. Set the reporting time frame to the last four days. Select the campaign and then drill down to the adset level. So, what I&#039;d do is I would have this paid attraction metrics spreadsheet up with my reporting data from the first four days, then I&#039;ll go to my ads manager and I would select the last four days. Let&#039;s just say there is like, you know if I&#039;m going ... well, it could be, you know these four days here. I&#039;d go update and then we go back to our instructions. Then it says select the campaign and then drill down to the adset level. So, I&#039;ve selected my cold traffic campaign and now I&#039;ve drilled down to that adset level, all right?

Now, we go back to my instructions. So, now it says observe the following columns: delivery, amount, reach, link click, CTR, CPC link, value video opt-in, cost per value video opt-in, survey applications, cost per survey application. So, we want to observe these columns and to get this, you want to click on columns and select, official tracking. You should have saved this one from the previous step. So, you should already have this. We covered it earlier on in this video, so if you donâ€™t know how to set this up, official tracking, go back and watch earlier on this video.

Now, we go back to our instructions and we&#039;ve done this. Step 4, take note of the adsets within KPI and the ad sets outside of KPI. What do the ones within have in common and what are the ones outside have in common? Update your audiences&#039; angles and images sheet with findings. So, we want to look at this and really observe them like we want to look at the ones that are doing the best. So, we can look at value video opt-ins, and we really want to look at the cost per value video opt-in here, and we want to look at the ones that are getting us quite a lot for not that much money. So, here I&#039;m getting, before these ads you know had issues ... don&#039;t worry about this. It&#039;s just a demo purpose here, but obviously some of these ads had issues and it was the Advice for Consultants ad because you can see all those but this Entrepreneur&#039;s Jet thing had no issues.

So, if I look at the one ... this is getting $1.10 leads, which is insanely cheap, this is not normal, and it says that you know I got eight of them for $1.10 and this is Joyce Meyer, that&#039;s pretty good, or three here from Power of Positivity for $2.93 or five here from 9 Entrepreneur&#039;s Jet, Tony Robbins. So, what you&#039;re really doing is you&#039;re really looking through here and you&#039;re trying to just observe which ad angle is working the best. Is it the 9 Entrepreneur&#039;s Jet one or is it the Advice for Consultants on? You should be testing two angles.

Then, the different audiences, how are they working? Is there any sort of trends or patterns that you can observe? What you want to do is update your audience&#039;s angles and images sheet with findings. So, you want to pull that spreadsheet up and you want to update everything. So, you would pull up your sheet like this and then what you would do is you would ... right here we&#039;ve got ideas. Now obviously, we have moved these ideas into the testing stage and now, what we really want to do is we really want to mark whether these things are working or not. So, now what I want to write is the results. Are these ads, are these different audiences working or not? Well, after four days we should be able to know. So, we can go back to our ads manager here and we can really look at the different audiences and tell which ones are working and which ones aren&#039;t.

So, you&#039;ll notice within the ads manager that you can&#039;t really click on a lot of these things. Like you can click on all of these, but you can&#039;t click on these, which is kind of annoying. So, you know one thing you can do is click on CPC and you know sort it by highest CPC because there&#039;s a high chance that the highest CPC ones won&#039;t be working and the lowest CPC ones, they might work quite well. As I can see here, this Tony Robbins one, you know it&#039;s got a cost per lead of a $1.68 and I&#039;m only playing a $1.17 per link click, which is pretty good and so you know, we can sort around in here and see what works and what doesn&#039;t.

Another thing you can do, which is sometimes easier because you can&#039;t sort by actual cost per survey and stuff, is you can just go export and you want to export as XLS, auto download, and then you can open it up on your computer, and you can quickly just sort in here. So, when you open this up, you want to go across to cost per value video opt-in and then what you want to do is just select this and then you can go, sort data, and then sort, and then you can go expand. You might have to select this, cost per video opt-in, okay, and then you can see how much it&#039;s costing. You know, surprisingly enough, like all of these are within KPI. It&#039;s just really just a fluke because I just randomly created these ads. That doesn&#039;t typically happen like that and the only reason these ones didn&#039;t get to deliveries because they got disapproved for some reason, but it&#039;s all right, this is just a demo.

So, what I would do is I would take note on all of these things here. So, if I&#039;m looking down here, these adsets are called, at the top, you know we really have Joyce Meyer, Tony Robbins, Power of Positivity, all these different things. So, what I&#039;m really doing is I&#039;m finding every ... you want to find everything that&#039;s within KPI and then you really just want to like, you know you can bold it or you can highlight it or whatever and then you can see which ones are within KPI, which ones are outside of KPI. Now, what you can do is you can go into your FB audiences, angles, images spreadsheet and you can write down next to this whether they work or not.

Now, as you can observe here, this is the importance of testing multiple angles because my best performing ads yet is Joyce Meyer with Advice for Consultants ad and then at the bottom of the KPI ones for the 9 Entrepreneurs Jet ad and you can see how Tony Robbins is here and this one&#039;s down here. So, you can see the importance of trying a different ad angles, but most of the time you can see that there is a correlation between audiences that work and audiences that don&#039;t work and whatever. So, what you want to do is just mark down all the ones that work. Now, if some of your adsets aren&#039;t working but they have that same audience as working for another adset, then you would still mark that as working, if that makes any sense.

So, we go into here and we&#039;d write, you know, next to each one audience results, winner, and then you&#039;d write down winner next to all the ones that were winning, and let&#039;s say you had some ... you&#039;d write down loser. So, this is how you know whether these work or not and you want to write this down. So, once we know for sure whether these win or lose, you want to copy them out of here and you&#039;d put the proven ones in here and then you&#039;d put the losing ones in here. So, this way you know, we&#039;ve got proven and we&#039;ve got failed, and we&#039;ve got ideas and testing. So, now our ideas and testing columns are free again.

Now, what we would do is we would go to angles ideas and here are all of our different angles. Now, what we would want to do is really grab these and then we&#039;d want to copy these and throw them ... they&#039;ve actually gone through testing, but we&#039;d put them into testing first and then we would mark whether this won or lost. So, right now if I went to the spreadsheet I&#039;ve been testing 9 Entrepreneurs Jet and Advice for Consultants, so I would go 9 Entrepreneurs Jet. Where is it? This one here. I&#039;d grab this and I&#039;d throw this one into the proven, boom. Then the other one would be, you know, the 26-year-old punk one, which I think I launched. No, it wasn&#039;t. It was the Advice for Consultants. So, where is that one? Just trying to find it. Here we go. Oh, just missed it. So, we grab this one and I&#039;ll put this one into proven as well, boom. Then these ones arenâ€™t in testing because I haven&#039;t tested them yet. These ones are still on ideas, sorry. Then you can see how I&#039;m organizing this.

For audiences, you should still have some audiences in here for ideas because we should have come up with 30 ideas but you probably only tested eight or something. When they&#039;re ideas, they stay here. When you&#039;re testing them, they come into here, and then when they&#039;re proven, they come into here, and if they failed, they come into here. This way, you&#039;re constantly just sorting audiences through from left to right, left to right. You&#039;re just moving them through like this and you&#039;re sorting them. You&#039;re coming up with ideas, testing them, proving them, and seeing which works, what doesn&#039;t. It&#039;s like scientific method for audiences.

Then with angles, we&#039;re doing the same. We&#039;re coming up with ideas. We&#039;re forming a hypothesis. We&#039;re putting them in here. Then once we&#039;ve formed our ideas, we submit some of them to the market for testing. We put them into the testing stage. Then if they work, we put them over here as proven winners and then if they don&#039;t work, we throw them in here as the losers, and that is the process we go through. You can export your data out of the ads manager to really look at that. You don&#039;t need to save that. You know, you don&#039;t even need to really export the data, but I find it easier sometimes because you just can&#039;t click on these things to sort them. It&#039;s a really annoying thing that Facebook has and sometimes it&#039;s easier to look in Excel.

So, then we go back to our sheet here and now it says, delete all ad sets outside of KPI for leads and outside of KPI for survey applications. If an adset is outside of KPI for leads but within KPI for survey applications, leave it on since applications take hierarchy. So, what this means is we could have an adset, for example, that has a cost per lead of like $16, right? Now that&#039;s outside of our KPI. However, it might have a cost per survey that is within our KPI. That is possible. Now, because cost per survey, it has rank over cost per lead, then we wouldn&#039;t delete it because we&#039;re always looking at the highest ranking KPI when we&#039;re judging things.

So, that&#039;s how we do it. So we&#039;d basically want to rank them and then anything that wasn&#039;t really working ... so for this, you&#039;d go through here and you&#039;d sort out what&#039;s the blue swan, what&#039;s the red swan, and you&#039;d just go and turn them off at first, boom, just so you can check them and make sure what&#039;s working, what&#039;s not. I&#039;m going to just look at this, so down here. So, you know all of these were actually doing pretty good, but I&#039;m just going to turn off these ones that didn&#039;t get approved. They just say these ones that didn&#039;t get approved were ... you know these are red swans, they just assumed that.

Once we&#039;ve turned off the ones that are red swans, we&#039;ve shut them off, then what we want to do is we want to delete them. It&#039;s best to get them out. So, we click on delivery and then we can sort by active ones and the only ones that should be left active should be our blue swans, which means they&#039;re profitable ad sets that are within KPI for cost per value video opt-in. Then what we do is we come down here and we select all of these that are inactive and then we want to double check to make sure they are in fact the red swans, and then what we would do is we go up here to more, and then delete, and boom, flush them out. Now, we&#039;ve really killed those from the population and now all we&#039;re left with is blue swans.

So, now if you come back to your sheet here it says step 5, delete all adsets outside of KPI. We&#039;ve done that. We&#039;ve left the ones that are within KPI. Now, step 6, observe what adsets you have left in your campaign. What their daily budgets are, what their CPL and CPC is and right now, with what&#039;s in your campaign, how many leads and surveys would you generate per day and per week? So, we really just want to have to think about this.  You know, if my average cost per survey is like six bucks and right now I have a total of 9 adsets spending a total of $10 each, that&#039;s $90 divided by 6. So, I can just quickly go here, 90 divided by 6.

So that means that I&#039;m going to get 15 opt-ins per day, right now, and I don&#039;t know what my actual survey conversion rate is because I don&#039;t have any surveys yet. So, it&#039;s good to keep that in mind and right now I&#039;m really going to be spending $90 per day with this healthy blue swan adsets. Then we can really look and think, &quot;Well, how many surveys would we get per week or per day right now if we just left it running like this?&quot; Right now, I can&#039;t really tell because I don&#039;t have enough data, but if you had more data than me then you should be able to kind of hypothesize about how many you&#039;d get.

Then step 7. Depending on your aspiration for scale and available daily budget, you want to start propagating your healthiest blue swans through duplication and you want to change the age by one year and change the budget at random to create micro variations. So, what I could do here, is I could look at my absolute, healthiest blue swans, which looks like this one here which has got five leads for a $1.88. So, I could grab this one and what I could do is I could duplicate it. Now, when you&#039;re going to propagate anything, you want to go to ads manager, power editor. Power editor is the best for doing duplications. I just want to make sure this is up-to-date, so I&#039;m just going to discard changes. Cool, You select your campaign in the adset level. The columns have changed a bit, so that&#039;s alright anyway. I go across and find which the best ones were.

So, it&#039;s kind of annoying how it does this, but if we go here and I go back into this one, then I select this one here and I look at my best, official tracking. if I look at my best performing one here, five. Oh, this one&#039;s actually got a survey application now, perfect. So, if I look at this one here and it&#039;s got five value video opt-ins $1.88 and it&#039;s called 9 Entrepreneurs Jet Tony Robbins. So within the power editor I could find 9 Entrepreneur&#039;s Jet Tony Robbins. Where is that? Boom, here. So you can select it here and then up here you can go duplicate. Then you want to use existing campaign and you want to make sure it&#039;s still on this campaign. Then you want to create copies that are identical to the original and then number of duplicates. So, for this one, I&#039;m probably just going to go ... if I make $90 and I want to get it back up to about $151, I&#039;m probably going to go and duplicate it three times. Actually, no. Yeah, I&#039;ll go two times.

Then I&#039;m going to go create. I&#039;m just going to create my duplicates here and now what I want to do is I want to just adjust these budgets here. So, I don&#039;t want to make the budgets really identical. I just want to change them a little bit just so we can kind of ... it really force the algorithms that thinks these aren&#039;t duplicates since budget is one of the main parameters when it comes to initial conditions. So, if I look through here, everything looks good. Now, what else might I want to propagate? Well, definitely this one because this one has already got a value video opt-in.

So, I&#039;m going to look here and it&#039;s called Ellen DeGeneres and it&#039;s 9 Entrepreneurs Jet. So, I&#039;m going to go here and then I&#039;m going to go 9 Entrepreneurs Jet, Ellen DeGeneres. Boom. Then I&#039;m going to triplicate this existing campaign, identical. I&#039;m going to go too for this. Create. So, now what I want to do is just adjust their budget for those swans. So, I can see here budget. I just want to create a little bit of randomness here to kind of fool algorithm. So, I might go to 13 on one of them and I might go 14 on one of them, right? Just a little bit of variation here. If we want to, we can change the age for this as well, which you can do by selecting all four of them and you could just select edit here and then you could adjust the age.

Now, adjusting the age isn&#039;t mandatory. I mean, you don&#039;t have to do it but it is advised to do it on at least half of the duplicate adsets. What we don&#039;t want to do is just triplicate ad sets and leave the budget and the age identical because then the algorithm can just kind of think, &quot;Oh, these are just identical,&quot; so then we will just group the two together and we donâ€™t want it to do that. So, now we have added some additional ad sets and if I was at $90 before, well now I made $100, $110, $120, $130. Some made about 130 bucks.

So, what I can do here is I can go review changes then I can go apply and then boom, it&#039;s going to publish our duplicate adsets. So, we&#039;ve just propagated some healthy blue swans, just like that. So it&#039;s 86%, it&#039;s almost done, 90%, 95%, boom, done. Now, if we go back to our ads manager, just give this a refresh, we will be able to see this triplicate ad sets appearing here. So, now it says I&#039;ve got 13 ad sets. These ones just pending review. Because these are all already active adsets, these should get approved a lot sooner and then they&#039;re going to start grabbing some traffic, which will be awesome.

Now, the next step is to go our own instructions and we have created some ... we&#039;ve propagated some of our healthiest blue swans and we&#039;ve called our red blue swans. So, that&#039;s really what we&#039;ve done. You know, we&#039;ve removed the red swans and ... well, first of all, we&#039;ve judged. What&#039;s the red swan? What&#039;s the blue swan? We&#039;ve removed the red swans by turning them off first. Then deleting them and then we&#039;re left on the blue swans and then we found the best of the blue swans and we&#039;ve propagated them and we&#039;ve duplicated them. So, now we&#039;re done with this. We&#039;re done with the judgment day.

Now it&#039;s time for judgment day aftermath. This is where we add swan DNA variation if necessary. So, after judgment day, if your ad and audience hypothesis was accurate, you should have a reasonable number of blue swan adsets left. The less blue swans you have, the less accurate your hypothesis was. So, with me in this demo example I&#039;ve been doing for you here, you know, I have quite a lot of blue swans here. I mean it&#039;s quite a lot out of, you know, I think I had quite a lot of blue swans here, really. Most people won&#039;t get that many to be blue swans in their first attempt, right? It&#039;s just because I&#039;ve done it a while, so even when I create ads that are just kind of off the cuff whatever, they still work.

So, it&#039;s not normal to really have this many blue swans, but if you do have these many blue swans, it means your ad hypothesis was really accurate and we were able to propagate some as well. However, if you have a low number here, well, here&#039;s what you need to do. So, if you&#039;re in a situation where you have less than two ad angles left running, consider adding another ad angle into the mix for testing and you want to find the next ad angle ranked on your list of five and then launch it with inquire for testing. So, if I notice here that the only ad angle I&#039;m left running would be say 9 Entrepreneurs Jet, let&#039;s say all Advice for Consultants ad angles were removed. Well, that means that really only one ad angle worked and the other ad angle didn&#039;t work.

So, then what I would do is I&#039;d make sure that it&#039;s updated on my sheet here. I would add the failed ad angle here and I&#039;d put the proven ad angle here. Then I would find the second ad angle for testing. So we&#039;d go to Quire, then I would log in to Quire, then I would select my ad account here, and then I would go to create ads. Then I would look on my template here and, you know, I would have tried my first two, so now it would be time to try my third one, which would be Advice for Consultants, if I was doing that. So, it might be time to try your third ad angle if you&#039;re only left with one ad angle here. That&#039;s what this means. So, if you&#039;re in a situation where you have less than two ad angles running, consider adding another one into the mix. Then you&#039;d find the next ad angle right down your list and then launch it through Quire and you already know how to launch it through Quire, right?

If you&#039;re in a situation where you have less than four audience interests left running, consider adding another two to four audience interests into the mix for testing and you want to find the next [lot 01:19:09] of audience interests ranked within your master list and then added to another targeting template or fragment so you can launch it. So, what we would do is when we observe in our, audiences angles, and images sheet. When we&#039;re only really running one angle, we want to move another angle from the idea stage up into the testing stage because we always want to have two angles running at a minimum. It&#039;s really important. You never just want to be caught running one ad angle. It&#039;s important that you have at least two. So, if you end up fully calling one of them, then move another one up from your ideas list.

Then with audiences, we always want to be running really a minimum of eight. So, if I look here, I&#039;ve got one two, three, four, five, six, seven. Let&#039;s say I&#039;ve got seven or I might decide well, I&#039;m going to try another three. So, I&#039;d come over to my audience ideas list here, and I&#039;d grab the next three, and I&#039;d copy this over into the testing column for testing. Then I would go into Quire, and then I&#039;d go to templates, and then I would create a new fragment. So, to do that, what you do is you just click on this, you go duplicate, then you grab it here, you rename, you can rename this one fragment 2, right?

So then you can double-click on fragment 2 and you can remove the fragments from here that you&#039;re already testing in fragment 1 and then you can remove the ones that have been proven not to work and just have in here the new ones which you want to test, right? Now what you can do is you can drag this in here and you can test this, then you can go into your ads and you can grab the two ad angles which you want to run. You might launch the one that&#039;s already working and then you might launch the new one which you want to test. So, that is how you do that.

Then step 4. So, with Facebook ads, we&#039;re constantly doing the following. We&#039;re running a four-day tests where you know we&#039;re really launching things and we&#039;re letting them run for four days to really go through the incubation period. Then, after those four days, we&#039;re coming to judgment day and that&#039;s when we&#039;re judging these adsets to see whether they&#039;re red swans or blue swans. Then if they&#039;re red swans, we&#039;re calling them, we&#039;re turning them off, and deleting them, and we&#039;re taking note of what works and what doesn&#039;t work. Then we&#039;re propagating the blue swans by duplicating them and we&#039;re just changing the age and the budget a little bit. Then we&#039;re adding new swan DNA variations into Eden for testing. What this means is we&#039;re going to find other ad angle ideas from that list and we&#039;re going to find other audience interest ideas from that list and we&#039;re shifting those in.

So, not only are we running some things that are working but we&#039;re also duplicating some things that are working, we&#039;re propagating it, and also we&#039;re making room for some testing stuff as well. So we&#039;re kind of juggling three things. We&#039;re continuing to run what&#039;s working. We&#039;re trying to scale up the things that are working. We&#039;re removing the things that aren&#039;t working and then we&#039;re adding some things into the mix that are new so that we&#039;re always testing. That&#039;s really the balance of a really solid Facebook campaign management. It&#039;s scaling the proven winners, calling the things that aren&#039;t working, flushing it out, and then having some room for constant testing and variation. That is how you want to run your campaign and that is really how you govern it the initial conditions. That&#039;s how you let it run for four days, then you come in, and you observe everything, and then you can make all of those changes on the fourth day.

As you can see, you know when we wait into the fourth day, there&#039;s quite a lot of stuff we can actually do. We can get a lot of metrics. We can get a lot of insights. We can see what&#039;s worked and what hasn&#039;t worked and we can actually start scaling some things up, cutting some things back, and even bringing some new things into the mix for experimentation. Now, that&#039;s the beauty of waiting four days. If we&#039;d only waited one day, we&#039;d probably just look at our numbers and then we&#039;d probably nervous or anxious or something and it might not be for any good reason at all because we don&#039;t even know what we&#039;re looking at. That&#039;s why it&#039;s so important to give them those four days. It really takes that long for the numbers to really define themselves and show. Before that period of four days, you&#039;re not really looking at anything. You&#039;re just looking at a whole bunch of noise and so that&#039;s why that four-day rule is vitally important.

So, this module has really just shown you, how to govern the initial conditions and how to perform the first judgment day that you&#039;re going to do and now the next training module after this is going to show you how to manage your Facebook campaigns day-to-day. So, you&#039;re only really doing this initial sort of purging like after your first four-day test when you first launched your ads and then you turn into just daily management mode. So, this is what you&#039;ll do the first time you launch and from here on out you&#039;re really just going to be in daily management mode and you just want to follow the workflow every single day that I&#039;m going to outline for you in that video. So, that&#039;s it for this training module. Thanks for watching and I&#039;ll see you on the next one right now.
