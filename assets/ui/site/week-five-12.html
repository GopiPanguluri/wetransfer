So in this training module, I’m basically going to show you the daily workflow that you’re going to go through every single day when it comes to managing your Facebook ads. So what I mean by that is when you wake up each morning at 8 or 9 or 10 a.m., whenever you decide to schedule your daily check in with your ads, you’re going to follow this workflow and this process to make sure that you check everything is working correctly, to make sure that you report everything correctly and to scale up and basically manage your Facebook ads. It’s really important that this is done every day. It’s important that it’s done properly. So this is an important training module so make sure that you pay close attention. So let’s jump right into it.

So here’s what we’re going to cover on today’s training. So the first piece is avoiding Gordian’s knot and this is the downfall of all blue swan empires. So this is the huge mistake that everyone makes and it’s the one thing which we truly want to avoid at all costs with our Facebook account and our campaigns and our funnels and everything. Then we’re going to discuss developing your quantum mind. This is how to be analytical, scientific and creative all at one time. So this is what we refer to as like a quantum mind.

It means when you’re in Facebook you’ve got to be really analytical. Like you’ve got to be in the numbers and you’ve got to be able to read those. Then you’ve got to be scientific too about like which things are we testing, which things are working, which things aren’t working and what are the cause and effect relationships. Then once you’ve diagnosed things, you have to be creative. You have to have out of the box ideas when it comes to different creative to run or different ad angles to write or different audiences to target. The people who are really good at Facebook ads, they have a quantum mind like this so we’re going to discuss how to do it.

Then we’re going to go into Evergreen Garden of Eden. This is constant testing, variation and propagation. So we’re going to talk about how you … like when you test your ads initially and you launch back in the Facebook genesis module, that is not just a onetime thing and then you’re done. You want to really have an evergreen testing process. You always want to be testing constantly because things can always get better and things that are working will eventually come to their end. So you always want to have things that you’re testing and you always want to have a healthy range of variation so that you’re always good to go. We’re going to show you how to do that.

Then daily workflow of the king. So this is your morning checklist for managing Facebook ads. So I’ve got a step by step process which you can go through every morning when you check on your ads. I’m going to give you a cheat sheet that you can print out and have handy so that every morning when you check on your ads you just go through step by step check it off and then you know you’re good for the day.

Then finally we’re going to discuss solving chaos in the kingdom. This is how to protect your blue swan empire. So really like when you’re managing your ads, how do we solve issues that come up? There’s all sorts of different issues that you can run into like your KPIs can go out. Facebook might disapprove an ad. You might stop getting traffic. You might stop getting clicks. All sorts of different things. I’m really going to explain every different possible scenario that could possibly happen with your ads and how to diagnose it and how to fix it. So really everything when it comes to effective Facebook campaign management. So that’s what we’re going to cover. Let’s jump into it.

So at this stage of the Facebook training, you should have gone live with your ads and then left them for four days and completed judgment day. So this was the previous module called Governing Initial Conditions. So you should have completed that module and you should have done your judgment day. You should have identified and judged blue swans and red swans. You should have culled the red ones and you should have updated your reporting and all of that stuff. That’s what we call judgment day.

Now you know how to create, launch and iterate a successful Facebook campaign. That’s an awesome accomplishment on its own. But, there’s more to Facebook ads than just creating campaigns, launching them and iterating. Somebody has to manage everything day to day. It’s not just about the launch process. It’s not just about the creation process. It’s not just about the initial judgment day process. It’s about ongoing daily management as well. That’s what we’re going to show you. That is what this video specifically is going to show you. So let’s get to work.

Now the first piece is avoiding Gordian’s Knot and this is the downfall of all blue swan empires. So Gordian’s knot is when you lose sight of cause and effect relationships between variables and no longer know why things are happening. When this happens, things get unruly, chaotic, out of control and unpredictable. It’s when you no longer know what’s … you can no longer make heads or tails of your Facebook account.

You’re looking at it and you’re like, “Why is this like that? I don’t know. Why did this do that? I don’t know.” It’s like things are happening all over the place and you have no idea why they’re happening. You might go to change something expecting something to happen and the opposite happens. So when those sorts of things happen, it’s a sign that your accounts really are going into chaos. This is what we call Gordian’s knot.

If we’re not careful and responsible with our daily practice and discipline, we will tie Gordian’s knot in our Facebook campaigns. When this happens, we will lose sight of what caused what and have no control over anything. When this happens, our only course of action is to flush out our entire campaign and start from scratch. Obviously, this isn’t something that we really want to do, because it takes a good amount of time to launch and grow a successful Facebook campaign.

The last thing we want to do is have to flush out all of our hard work but that’s what you have to when you tie Gordian’s knot because it’s the only way to get a fresh start. You have to just flush it all out and start again when you lose sight of cause and effect relationships, because you have just turned it into a big bird’s nest. Everything is just crossed everywhere and you just don’t know what’s going on.

The solution is not to try and solve Gordian’s knot since most of the time it’s unsolvable. I’ve looked at a lot of Facebook ad accounts that have got into chaotic states. I’ve looked at them. I’m just like, “I could probably spend a month trying to perform some sort of forensic analysis on this thing and try to identify what’s going on.” In that amount of time, it would just be worth just flushing everything out, deleting everything and starting fresh again. So there’s no point ever really trying to solve it. You just want to delete everything out and start fresh. So really what we want to do and what the solution really is, is to prevent tying Gordian’s knot in the first place. This can be done by only iterating one variable at a time when testing and this is huge. This is really important.

So for example, you have three variables here. You have your ads and your funnel and your script. So you’ve got your funnel, that could be one variable. Then you’ve got your Facebook ads that could be one variable. Then you’ve got your script on what you’re saying on these sales calls that could be another variable. It’s a good idea not to go and change more than one thing at a time when you’re doing that. So in the beginning when you’re going through and you’re trying to test different things, you want to identify one place to improve.

So if you think that your ads are the weak point, the weak link in this string, then you want to only be really iterating and experimenting with your ads. You want to hold your funnel constant, not be making any changes there and whatever you’re saying on the script, you want to keep that constant too. Otherwise, you don’t know if something got better, you might think, “Oh it was my ads.” Really it could have been your script or your funnel, you just don’t know, right? Even if things get better, you don’t know. Most of the times things get worse and you don’t know like what caused it. You lose sight of cause and effect whenever you iterate any more than one variable of the three.

So if you want to improve your ads, hold two constant, funnel and script, just iterate ads. If you want to improve your funnel, hold ads constant, hold script constant and just iterate funnel. Then if you want to iterate what you’re doing on the phone, then it’s best to hold funnel constant and ads constant and just iterate on the script. This is huge. I know it might not sound like much but when you do this, you can never really lose sight of cause and effect.

If something doesn’t work but it did work, you know what it is because you’re only changing around one thing and the rest you’re holding constant or specifically within the ads piece, you might be testing message, image, audience. So this could be three variables within the ad. If you’re trying to improve your ads for example, you really want to just iterate like one of these variables at a time. So you might be iterating message. You might be iterating the images for a particular message or you might be iterating different audience interest groups, but you don’t really want to iterate two or three of these at a time, because you know that you might lose sight of cause and effect relationships and that’s when you tie a Gordian’s knot.

As soon as you lose sight of cause and effect, you just don’t know what’s going on anymore. As soon as you don’t know what’s going on, you start acting irrational. You just start clicking on random things and you just start getting like I don’t even really know a word for it. People just go a bit nutty when they can no longer see cause and effect. They just start clicking on random things. As soon as that starts happening, the whole account is gone. The whole thing is absolutely ruined. So that’s why you don’t want to do that.

Another preventative measure is to keep your ads account clean. So deleting old ads. If you have any ads that had turned off, just go ahead and delete them. There’s absolutely no reason to store things in there. We don’t need to store all of the stuff. Like just flush it out. Delete it. I used to just turn ad sets off but then my account got so bogged down that I just went and purged all the stuff that was turned off and life got a lot easier

. There’s absolutely no reason to hold old stuff in there. If you’ve got old campaigns, delete them. Anything that’s old, you might as well go ahead and delete it. When we’re calling red swans, we turn them off first then we double check that they are in fact red swans. Then when we’re sure, then we select them all and delete them. So even delete those ones.

Some people think it’s a good idea to keep ads and campaigns and things within their account so that they can tell what worked and what hasn’t ... what has and hasn’t worked in the past but that’s a really bad idea because for one, that when they actually do need to know that information, they go into their ads account and they can’t find it. So it’s like they’re saving all of this information. They’re causing all of this clutter and the premise for them even trying to do thatin the first place is invalid because even when they come to try and do that, it doesn’t work. So it’s not just worth it.

You want to take your notes in the spreadsheets which I provided like your Facebook audiences, angles and images, worksheet and also your performance … your paid attraction metrics spreadsheet. So that’s where you should keep all of your data. That’s where you know what angles worked. That’s where you know like what images worked, what audience interests worked. That’s what you know what you’ve been testing, what has failed, what has succeeded. Then in your paid attraction metrics spreadsheet, you’ve got all the data you could ever need day to day. So there’s no need to really keep stuff that’s off in your Facebook ads account.

Another huge one is naming things correctly. Now I made a big point of this in campaign genesis and those other nodules earlier when we go to name our audience interests, when we name our different folders with inquire, also when we launch our ads, how we use correct names for everything. The reason why we do this is because when we come back and look at our account, we can see what’s what. I see some people’s accounts and they call things like SSS9 and XYZ8 and like 222X and they just type some random numbers in for all this different stuff.

Then when someone does that, it seems okay at the time and it probably is okay at the time but later on, it turns into chaos because you look at your ads account and you just don’t know what’s what anymore. That’s why having correct name conventions is important. You also want to keep track of and report on your numbers daily and take notes of what does and doesn’t work.

So with the spreadsheets that I’ve given you, the Facebook audience’s angles and images worksheet as well as the paid attraction metrics spreadsheet, you want to make sure that you’re plugging in your numbers daily and really reporting there. You can pretty much see all the different trends. What’s working, what’s not working. You can diagnose pretty much all the problems just from keeping that data into those spreadsheets. So make a habit of that.

If you do all these things which I’ve described on the screen here, then you should be able to avoid Gordian’s knot all together which is great. If you don’t follow the stuff and if you’re not disciplined and you’re not responsible, without daily practice, then this sort of thing will become unruly very quickly. Once it becomes unruly, the only way to solve it is really to flush it down and start over. So make sure you do that.

Now we’re going to discuss developing your quantum mind. This is when you’re analytical, scientific and creative all at one time. This is fascinating because this is one thing that pretty much psychologists in society and all of those different things, they say that you can’t do this. They say people are either left brain or right brain or whatever, but it’s not true at all. If you’ve got like a quantum mind, then you’re both all the time. That’s the way you really want to be.

So developing your quantum mind. Being analytical and creative at one time. So Facebook ads has nothing to do with emotion and everything to do with numbers when you’re managing ads yourself. So you must keep calm and focused at all times and use your analytical brain not your emotional brain. So when you’re actually going in and looking at all of your numbers and doing your reporting, turn all of your emotions off. You’re just pure analytical. You’re just looking at the numbers. You’re not judging anything. You’re not thinking about anything. You’re not feeling anything. You’re just looking at the numbers. You’re just reporting, staying analytical, calm.

You want to use tough minded analysis to diagnose issues. So for example, you want to report on everything and then you still want to use your analytical mind to diagnose where the issue is so we might for example diagnose that the issue is with our cost per click and then we might look in and see that really it’s … the thing that’s pushing cost per click up is a low CTR, low click through rate and the reason because of that … the reason that’s causing that is really because our ad isn’t resonating well. So we can use our analytical mind to really diagnose that.

However, if we would use our emotional mind, then we might look at that and be like, “Oh my God! My Facebook ad is not working. I knew this wouldn’t work.” and just freaking out. That’s the difference. When you use your analytical mind, you can really drill down and find the source, the root cause of the issue. Once you found it, then it’s important to really shift into more of a free minded creativity state to solve it. So you really need to learn to be in both hemispheres of your mind at the same time. This is what we call a quantum mind.

So this is when you can be analytical, look at the numbers, report on everything, keep your emotions at bay, drill down, find the source of the problem. Then once you’ve identified it and diagnosed it, then you can think outside the box and be creative when it comes to solving it. When you’re able to do these two things at once, it makes you very, very dangerous in business, in ads and everything. Like they found the best hedge fund managers and the best traders and all of these people, they’re really in both hemispheres. They’re not just the quants that are just looking at all the analytical stuff.

They’re also hugely creative in everything but they’re able to flick back and forth between the two pretty much instantly. It’s a good thing to try and solve. So you don’t want to think, “I’m not analytical. I’m not good with numbers.” That’s bullshit. That’s a choice. No one is like born good at numbers. It’s just a choice. So you can be. You shouldn’t think I’m not very creative because again that’s bullshit too. It’s just a choice. So you can be both.

You must check on your ads every day and report all the key metrics into your paid attraction metric spreadsheet so that you can keep track of everything. By doing this, you’ll become familiar with all of our KPIs and start to notice patterns as they occur not when it’s too late. You want to print out the KPIs cheat sheet and look at it daily. So I’ve included it for download in the resources section. It’s a pdf called paid attraction metrics. You can download it. Then you can … it’s a good idea to print it out, put on your wall and just remind yourself every day of our KPIs. You want to just drill it into your brain so that you remember them.

Then when you’re reporting every single day, you will also remember this as well. After a while, these numbers will start to become … at first they’re foreign and it’s a clumsy sort of experience and process because it’s hard to do and it’s hard to know what you’re really doing. After you’ve done it a while and after you have gotten into the grove of things, the numbers will start like really speaking to you. You’ll be able to tell fully what you are doing.

Each day when you cull red swans which is when we identify the red swans, the unprofitable assets, turn them off and delete them and propagate blue swans which is when we identify the healthiest blue swans and we duplicate them. Make sure you’re looking at four day rolling averages and not one day instances when it comes to KPIs. This is huge. Blue swans can have days where they’re red and red swans can have days where they’re blue. The true nature of the swan appears over four day averages. So this is huge.

Never ever, ever analyze and judge from one day timeframes. Always use four. So in the beginning when we give our ads like that incubation period of four days, we want to make sure that we’re not judging them until day four. Then when we’re managing our ads and scaling everything, we’re never looking at daily numbers. We’re just looking at four day numbers. Very important because these things change. What matters is the average. That’s where the true nature appears.

Another thing is to never assume or think anything. Don’t assume. Don’t think. Test it. Get a data point and act accordingly and use the troubleshooting cheat sheet. You know with Facebook ads this isn’t some like hope or chance thing. This is an absolute and exact and precise science. We’re using scientific method. We’re using data. This is not like a chance thing. It’s not like, “Oh if you try, it might work or it might not work.” It’s just like if you follow the process and you actually just follow how I’ve outlined it for you, it will work. You might have to iterate it a few times to get it to work but it will work. It’s just a fact. The only way it can possibly not work is if you don’t follow the process.

So don’t assume or think anything. Don’t get your emotions up or down. Just whenever you’re in doubt of something, test it. Like it’s so cheap to create an experiment and test something with Facebook ads. Then once you test it, you’re going to get a data point. Once you have a data point, now you actually know. So you’re not assuming, you’re knowing. Like why guess when you can know. That’s what we can do with Facebook. Then once you know and you’ve got some data behind it and you’ve got an actual experiment to back it up, now you can make your decisions and act accordingly.

You can also use the troubleshooting cheat sheet. I’ve included that for download beneath this video. However, I covered it in detail in the previous module which was called Governing Initial Conditions. I’ll just show you what it looks like right now. It is available for download pdf and it looks like this. It just says troubleshooting Facebook ads and funnels. Use this cheat sheet to troubleshoot issues with your Facebook ads and funnels. Before consulting this cheat sheet, you should have completed all modules in week five fractal Facebook evolution. If you haven’t followed our process and methodology step by step, then this cheat sheet is going to be of little to no value.

Make sure you follow this process step by step and then refer to this cheat sheet after four days of live testing with your campaign. Work through this process sequentially to identify your issue and fix it. Then we can see all the different issues you could possibly have and their answers. So like my Facebook ads are not getting approved, here’s your answer. My Facebook ads are not receiving any impressions, here’s what you need to do. My KPIs are outside of the student benchmark range. My Facebook ads are not receiving any clicks. My Facebook ads are not spending anywhere near the daily budget I set for them. My cost per click, CPC, on Facebook is out of KPI.

My click through rate or CTR on Facebook is out of KPI. My relevant score or REL on Facebook is out of KPI. My cost per 1000 impressions or 1k impressions which is also known as CPM on Facebook is out of KPI, well here’s what you do about it. My cost per lead is out of KPI, here’s what you do about it. My cost per survey application, CPS, or video conversion rate, VCR, is about of KPI, well here’s what you do about it. You can see like I’ve taken the time to really go through these things. This stuff here I haven’t just worded these things. You just can’t word these things.

I’m not just explaining it like there’s actual data points and processes here. I know by the numbers and the parameters of every different thing it could possibly go wrong and what you should do about it and what the causes and all of the stuff. So if you truly follow this stuff, I mean there’s absolutely no chance that you won’t be successful with your Facebook ads. So you just have to be committed and methodical and follow the process.

Here’s another one. My call show up rate, SUR, is out of KPI, well here’s what you do about it. My call conversion rate, CCS, is outside of KPI, well here’s what you do about it. My cost per acquisition, CPA, is outside of KPI, here’s what you do. My return on investment, ROI, is outside of KPI, well here’s what you do. I’ve covered every possible instance. I really mapped it out. I looked at every different way a person could go through this process and run into issues or anything. So every single metric on our paid attracting metric spreadsheet from this dashboard page and if we look in one of these months like all of these things here, every single metric I have covered in detail here.

So if one of them is out, this cheat sheet will tell you what to do. It really just serve you as a hand guide in an instruction sheet. Like if ever you run into any trouble or you can troubleshoot with this right here. So this is definitely something that you want to make sure that you familiarize yourself with. Download it. Print it out. You might put it next to your desk or something. For whenever you have issues with Facebook, you can just refer to this. This thing is worth its weight in gold.

So this is what I mean about having a quantum mind. Be analytical. Be thorough. Be methodical. Use the numbers, report on everything but then when it comes to solving problems and innovating, jump outside of the box. Start thinking, create wildly. That’s how you get the best results. You don’t want to be too rigid and binary in any one state. People who are too creative get burned on Facebook. People who are too analytical get burned on Facebook. The people who master it, the people who absolutely own it, they’re both.

Finally, don’t think like, “Oh no my campaign isn’t working.” Like that’s not how you do anything in business or in life. You don’t just throw your hands up in the air and go, “Oh no it’s not working. Oh my God I knew it wasn’t going to work. Well I knew this Facebook ads thing isn’t going to work.” That’s not an answer. That is really just forfeiting and having a cry about it. So what you want to do is test it, get the data. A campaign isn’t not working but you just don’t say that. What you do is you drill down and identify the source of the problem. So if your campaign isn’t working, why? What KPI is out of our benchmark range? If there’s multiple ones, what are they? Then when you identify them, go and look. How do you troubleshoot that? Then troubleshoot it and do it. So there’s just no such thing as “Oh no my campaign isn’t working.” That isn’t an answer.

So what you want to do is test it, get the data, compare it with the student benchmarks which we provide you with here. So all you have to do is follow the process in this Facebook ads training and then what you want to do launch it and everything. Then report your data in here, all these spreadsheets add everything up for you. It’s so simple. You just have to plug in the numbers. It’s like a toddler could almost do this. Then on the performance dashboard, it tells you your numbers then it tells you the student benchmark numbers. Then you just want to see where you’re in and where you’re out of KPI.

Then once you’ve identified the source of that issue, then you want to go to the troubleshooting guide and find the specific KPI that’s out and solve it. It’s just as simple as that. There’s just no such thing as “Oh no my campaign isn’t working.” Test it, get the data, compare it with the benchmarks. Find the bleeding. Look up the solution to the bleeding. Fix the bleeding and get back in the game and fucking win. That’s how it works.

Now we’re going to talk about the evergreen Garden of Eden. This is constant testing, variation and propagation. So if you remember when we were earlier on in the Facebook training, around the campaign genesis module, we launched all of our different variations into the Garden of Eden for testing and then we identified the healthiest blue swans and then we cull the unhealthy red swans. That’s how we really started the evolution of our ads. A lot of people think it’s just a one-off thing like you just do it once then you’re done. That’s what amateur Facebook advertisers do. The real pros, the masters, the wizards of it, they keep an evergreen Garden of Eden. They always testing variations in Eden. They always try to find a better breed of swan. They always try to update the empire. This is done through constant testing, variation and propagation.

So like I said most people treat testing as a starting stage and then they forget about it only to find that their entire campaign is dead and they’re forced to test it again from step one. So let me explain this process. So someone launches using the process. They’ve gone through the Garden of Eden stage. They’ve identified the blue swans and then they start letting those run. They might hike the budget so duplicate them or whatever. Then they’re going well for a week maybe. Maybe they won’t even make it to a week. Then they might go for two or three weeks and then the entire thing just stops.

All the KPIs blow out and all the campaign just stops receiving traffic or it becomes so unprofitable that the owner just got to shut it off. Then they’re forced to go back and test in the Garden of Eden again. So if you just cease to test in the Garden of Eden, then you will eventually be forced to test in the Garden of Eden. That’s who it works. If you’re constantly testing there, then you’ll never have to be forced there because you’ll always going to be okay. That’s how these things work. By ignoring one, you have to face it.

So when managing a successful Facebook campaign, it’s important to understand that you’re never finished with testing. Like it’s not an end state. It’s not an end goal. It’s forever. You’re never done. You’re always testing. Testing is a never ending process and it should be constantly running in parallel to scaling and management. At all times you should allocate a portion of your budget towards testing and you should be running at least two to three unique ad angles at a time to test at least eight and you should be testing at least eight unique audiences at a time.

So when you are going through and you’re testing you different variations, if you start culling some red swans and deleting them out, you always want to take note of how many different audience interests are actually running live and how many different ad angles are running live. You never want to just have one ad angle and you never want to just have two or three audiences. You want to have at the bare minimum two ad angles and at the bare minimum really like four to eight audience interests. That’s what you want to do.

With like an evergreen Garden of Eden, you also want to be testing stuff. So even if stuff is working, it doesn’t mean you don’t test. You’re always testing some stuff in the background maybe a new ad angle, maybe some new audience interests. You’re always testing because you know that even the stuff that’s working for you now is eventually going to cease to work. So that’s why we always testing because we know that everything has its useful life. By the time that comes which we can’t predict, we wanted to have something there that’s ready to go because no one can predict the life of these things. So you want to always make sure that you’ve got something in the garden ready to go when it happens or really before it happens. That’s the smart way to do it.

To do this, you want to grow your pool of proven angles and proven audience interests. Constantly grow that pool up. The bigger that pool gets of angles that work and proven audience interests that work, the more consistent and reliable your Facebook performance will be. When you have successful ad sets, don’t just leave them to grow old and stop working. This is what some people do. They have a successful Facebook ad sitting there like, “Oh yes this thing is working.” So they might just let it run or they might duplicate it or they might hike the budget and then they just leave it. This is not what you want to do because eventually they’ll just stop working.

At that point, you then can’t go and duplicate it because now the host is like infected. You can’t duplicate it once it’s failed. It’s just like you can’t propagate dead organisms. That just doesn’t happen. They have to be alive to propagate and they have to be healthy too. So when they’re healthy and proven over at least a four day period, start propagating them through duplication. So when ad sets are working, that’s when you should duplicate them. Very important, never duplicate them until they’re four days old. What might happen in that initial four day incubation period is if they look good on day one and we duplicate them or we might actually not have known on the fourth day they were going to reveal their true nature and look unhealthy.

So now what we’ve got is now we’ve got a scaled up version of some unhealthy cells and that’s obviously all going to become unhealthy at scale which is something that we don’t want. So this is why we use that four day incubation period. Then we get to see the true nature of the thing. Once we know the true nature, then we’re able to make a decision about scaling and propagating. That’s when we start to do that. This is an important thing to keep in mind.

As you start testing more variations and propagating more successful blue swans, you’ll have so many blue swans that you can start culling the worst performing blue swans in an effort to lift the average performance. So when you get a really good ads account set up and going, you’re going to have so many blue swans that you’re going to start culling the bottom quarter of your blue swans. I know we say we don’t turn off and delete like blue swans, but when you start to have so many good ones, you’re just starting to measure them in performance and get rid of the bottom ones and keep adding them in and keep adding them in.

Each time you’re really just lifting that average. That’s when you start to get a Facebook ads campaign really humming. So that’s some ideas. It’s really good to really keep this in mind that you’re never done with testing and you always want to keep this evergreen. You always want to be experimenting, always flushing out ads with new variations and always propagating healthy ads because eventually we know they’re not going to be healthy.

Now we’re going to discuss the daily workflow of the king. This is your morning routine for managing your Facebook ads. This is a workflow that you should follow in a sequential process from one through to seven. So number one, complete this workflow once a day every day at ideally 8 a.m. to 10 a.m. in the morning and always report on yesterday’s data. So you really want to do it in the morning because that’s the best time to look at ads because you’re going to be looking at yesterday’s data.

If you do it at night, well you’ve got to wait until after midnight to get the full day. Then what happens is it takes a while for Facebook to really aggregate all of the right numbers. So if you look just after midnight, quite often you’re not seeing the full picture anyway. It’s always best to wait until the morning and between about 8 and 10. Then it’s good to make your changes at that time in the morning too because then it gives your ads if you’re going to propagate anything or scale it or whatever, it gives your ads that full day to experience that day. If you do them in the middle of the day or at night, well they only really experience like half of it.

So it’s good to get into the routine of doing it every day at about 8 to 10 a.m. in the morning and you always want to report on yesterday’s data. You want to make your changes then and then get out. It’s a once every 24 hour thing. That’s it. You’re not looking at them like a hawk. You just come in, do your work, get out. That’s it. It shouldn’t take any longer than one hour each morning. It’s very simple. Very simple process. You have to be disciplined with this.

So step two. This is what you want to do once you start in the morning between 8 and 10 a.m. every day. So open Facebook business manager and have the columns for reporting. Have the right columns for reporting. So I’m going to show you how to do this on my screen right now. So you want to go to business.facebook.com and then you want to launch your number one ad account. Then you want to see your ads here. I’ll go back to my instructions.

So open the Facebook business manager and you want to have these columns for reporting. Delivery, amount, reach, link clicks, CTR link, CPC link, value video opt-ins, cost per value video opt-in, survey applications, cost per survey application. So to do that, what we do is we select our campaign which right now is just cold traffic conversions. Then we go to ad sets for campaign. Then what we do is we select … from here you should have something called official tracking.

If you don’t have one called official tracking that has all of these in it, go back to the previous module which was called … What was the previous one? It was Governing initial conditions. So you want to go back to that video and watch it in full and it will tell you how to set this up. You basically click on here. Then you click on customize, columns and set it up. You want to save it as official tracking.

Here we have everything we need. Delivery, amount, impressions, reach, link clicks, CPC link, CTR link, survey applications, value video opt-ins, cost per survey application and cost per value video opt-in. So we’ve got them all like this. We’re selecting cold traffic conversions all on campaign, drilling down to the ad sets for that one campaign.

Then what you want to do is set the timeframe window to yesterday and report all key numbers from Facebook to your paid attraction metric spreadsheet and make sure your report on real numbers not just Facebook numbers and to get the relevant score that you can export to excel. I’m going to show you how to do this right now.

So first thing you want to do is just set this here to the previous day which let’s just assume for me that’s the 12th right here. This is just a demo so don’t take it literally. So I update it. Let’s assume I’m looking at yesterday’s data here. You always want to report on yesterday’s data and you select it in the timeframe thing here. Then it says we want to be reporting with real numbers.

So what are real numbers? When reporting data into your paid attraction metrics spreadsheet, you want to make sure that you’re using real data and not just relying on the data that Facebook shows you in the ads manager reporting columns. So I covered this in significant detail in the previous module called governing initial conditions. If you didn’t see it, you can go back and watch it now.

However, just very quickly, this sheet here shows us where we get all of our different metrics from. So when we open up our paid attraction metrics spreadsheet and we go to month one and we start putting all of these numbers in here, this chart here shows us where we get this from. So things like ad spend and stuff we get from Facebook and then these ones in red, we get from a unique place. So to get relevance, we get from Facebook by downloading to excel and then for clicks we use bitly.com to track.

For leads, we get directly you’re your CRM and for surveys you get directly from your CRM. It shows you where you get all this data for. The reason we do this is because Facebook’s data is not the most accurate data, but sometimes it gives good data for some metrics and sometimes it doesn’t. So these ones, this chart here will just show you where you get this data from. If you do this, you will have the most accurate data that you can possibly have and you know you’re going to be looking at some solid metrics. That’s how you do that.

So what I’m going to do right now is I’m just going to walk you through how we actually do that. So I’m going to open up this. You’ll want to open your paid attraction metric spreadsheet. You’ll want to go to your right tab, your right month and then what you’ll want to do is enter in the right data. So what we do is we go to our ads manager and we select the right campaign. We drill down into the ad set for that campaign. We select the official tracking columns and we’ve got these here. We’ve selected yesterday.

Now what we do is we find our ad spent. Let’s say my total ad spent is 66.68 so I put this in. Now yours is going to be more like $150 because you would have been following instructions. In my case, I’ve just done a demonstration. Then impressions. We go to our ads manager. Total impression, 3035. So 3035.

What about my relevant score? Here’s how we get this. So if we go here, relevance, get from Facebook by downloading to excel. So what we do is we click on … we drill down to the ads level. We click on ads, should have that one campaign selected. We select all here. Then we go export. We select xls export. It compiles a spreadsheet for us. Downloads it. Then we can go check it out.

So we can download it like this and then we should have a relevant score here. Now I don’t have a relevant score here because my ads are too new. Sometimes it takes a while but what I’ll try and do is go for a longer timeframe just to show you a demo of what it could potentially look like. Still not getting enough traffic to really have a relevant score. So that’s okay. It can take a while to get a relevant score but that’s fine. So that’s how we get that number.

Now let’s just assume that mine is five. So you just put in number five. Then CPM. Well CPM auto calculates for you. All these gray cells they auto calculate for you. You don’t have to do anything. All you have to do is plug in the white ones. So then clicks. It’s a good idea to look at first of all what Facebook says so we can click on the ad set level and then we want to be looking at length clicks here. We can look down the bottom and here it says 53. I’m just going to make sure I’m on the right day because I was supposed to be on today. So link clicks was 35. What you want to do is you just don’t want to trust this. You also want to go and use something like bitly.com.

Bitly.com you can create a free account. Basically what it is it’s a link tracker. So you can go create that bit link. You can put in your landing page url which will be something like https://samovensdemo.com/casestudy. You could create a link like this and it’s for your … you want this to direct it to your landing page, the front page of your fragmentation funnel where your people opt-in for the case study video. Then you want to create it and you can name it something like fragmentation funnel Fb ads.

Once you’ve done that, then you can copy and then if I open a new window here and I paste that link, you can see it goes to my landing page. I put in this bitly link and it went to my landing page, right? It says two clicks now. If I refresh this, it says three clicks. That’s because this is a very accurate and up to date link tracking system. We can see where we got our traffic from and we can see how many clicks we got. Then we can also see our locations which is really useful because if we start to get a lot of clicks from these strange countries and stuff, it’s obvious that something strange is going on with our Facebook ads. That’s definitely something that we want to be aware of.

So instead of just trusting Facebook to provide us with this data, what they say here, we want to look at this number but then we want to check out bitly. We want to select the right date range which might just be like the 13th for example. We want to make sure that we’re looking at the right date. We want to make sure that we’re seeing how many clicks we got.

Then what we want to do is our next one. So CTR will auto calculate. CPC will auto calculate. Then we will get leads. We have to get this number our self. So you can have a look in the ads manager and you can look at value video opt-ins. Down the bottom it’s saying that I got 11 leads today on July 12. If I just go lifetime update, it’s saying that I got a total of 16 leads. You want to look at this table here and it says that we get … Leads: Get directly from your CRM which if you followed our process is active campaign.

So what you do is you go to activecampaign.com. You want to log in to your account here. You want to click on lists. You want to click on your value video opt-ins list. I’ve had to create two because I’m doing one for testing. It says here that I’ve got 16 opt-ins. This is really good because Facebook is saying that I’ve got 16 as well. So this is accurate but a lot of the time this is a little bit inaccurate. That’s totally fine. That happens sometimes.

So don’t freak out if Facebook doesn’t match with this but don’t get too excited if it matches as well. Even though it matches now, it’ll definitely not match at other times. It just kind of moves around like this. When reporting number of leads, always use yoru actual CRM. You want to make sure that you sort the date range and you’re looking at the right date range here.

So let’s just assume that I got a total of 16 leads today. It’s going to auto calculate my landing page conversion rate which is 37%. It’s going to auto calculate my CPL, cost per lead, which is $4.17. So you don’t need to do anything in these gray columns. Now surveys, well we have to get to this data ourselves because if we look in our table here … Surveys: Get directly from your CRM active campaign. So what we do in this case is we go to our CRM. Then we go to lists and then we click on survey applications. So I’ve just created this one survey applications two to use this as a demo.

I’d sort by the date range. I can see that I got one survey application. I can see this. Now what’s cool is if we click in to this person, we can see their recent activities. So three hours ago, they filled out the survey and they put in all of their information. Like they have no website, less $1,000 a month, what’s your target monthly revenue, all of the stuff. We can see all of this which is perfect. This is why this is such a cool setup.

Now we’d go back to this and we’d look at how many we got for our survey applications. We’d select the specific date range which would be yesterday. I got one survey. So my value video or my video conversion rate or value video conversion rate is 6.25%, auto calculates. My cost per survey is $67. This auto calculates.

Now how many calls? Well let’s look at our table here. Calls: Get from your call recordings or notes. So if you’ve done a call, you should know about it and you should probably have notes on it. If you don’t have notes on it, it should be in your Google calendar or it should be in schedule one. You should know if you did a call or not but you’ll also have your recordings folder as well. So this number you can get yourself. You plug in the number of calls. Let’s say I did one. Now it’s going to auto calculate your show up rate. So if we had one survey, one call that means our show up rate is 100%. Our cost per strategy session is going to be equivalent to our cost per survey because of the shop right here.

Now how many sales? Well if we look at our thing here. Sales number: Get from Stripe or note. So if you’re using Stripe in pay funnels, you’ll find it there or you’ll have notes on it. Everyone should know what the sales is. Then sales dollars you can get from Stripe or notes as well.

Let’s just say that I had zero sales today and zero dollars in revenue. So my call conversion rate is zero obviously because I didn’t get anyone to sign up. My cost per acquisition is just going to get this failed thing here because it can’t calculate this. My profit or less, I’m going to lose $67 today because I spent 67, I made zero so minus 67. My ROI, there’s absolutely nothing right now. We can ignore these numbers until we get up to the fourth day. So that’s how it works.

So we go back to our daily workflow here. It says you want to report on real numbers. I’ve shown you how to do that. What you probably want to do is download this. I’ve included it for download beneath this video in the resources section. You want to have this out and you also want to have out your daily workflow. I included this for download as well because I know how important this is going to be.

So here it is. It’s called daily Facebook ads workflow. In here it shows you exactly what to do. Here’s the workflow/process. You just work through here step by step. Then you’ve got a link to the troubleshooting guide too if you need to go through that. So you’ve got everything here. You can also get this … where to get the data from as well. You can get the cheat sheet below the video as well and this is good to have handy next to it.

So the next step, step four, is to look at one, two, three, four and seven day timeframe windows to see how data changes over time. What you want to do is make observations about ad angles and audience interests that are working or not working. You want to update your Facebook messages, angles and images worksheet. So when we do this, we want to open up our Facebook ads manager. We want to be looking at this particular campaign. We want to try changing these date ranges around. We want to look over four day averages. Then we want to look over three, two, one so on and so forth. We can look at seven as well. That is how we do that.

When reporting on these numbers here, to get these things to add up … so I’ll show you what I mean. If I just go and enter in day two data, day three data, day four data and if I just do that, you’ll see that nothing is popping up here for me in these gray columns. So if you go and you fill out all this data for all of the stuff, nothing is coming up here. What you need to do is you need to click on this top one and then drag down. We need to select these, drag down to really drag the formulas down. Just like that.

Now you’ll notice that we will get … let’s just say I got one sale this day, one sale this day. You’ll notice that if there’s a zero here, you will get this div error. In this case if you get that, you need to just enter a zero to make sure there’s no errors. Otherwise, what you’ll get is you’ll get errors down here. If you get errors down here, then you’ll also get errors in here. Now you can see because there’s no errors anywhere. My performance dashboard is working. Looks nice and clean. So I’m going to go back into our instructions.

So when we’re looking at one, two, three and four day and seven day timeframes, we want to really observe and see what’s going on. Then we want to update our audience interests and our Facebook angles. The worksheet to do that is Facebook audiences, angles and images worksheet. So what we do is we go into our Facebook audiences, angles, images worksheet. Then we look at our ads manager here and what we want to do is we really want to observe like what is working and what isn’t.

The best way to do this is really to select the four day timeframe. So I’m going to just imagine this as like the last four days. We’ve reported on our single day here. Each day we’ve reported the single day but when we’re making decisions to turn things off, we’re never using single days. We’re using four day windows. So what we do … the best way I find is often just to go export here. Save as xls. I find it a lot easier to sort in excel than it is to sort in here.

So when we get this, we can just open it up. It looks like this. Then what you want to do is you can scroll across and you want to be looking at this one here which is cost per value video opt-in and actual value video opt-ins. Then what you want to do is select this, then you want to go data and then you want to go sort. We want to go Z to A. So actually we want to go low to high, A to Z. Expand the selection.

So these ones up here are our best performing ones and we can see that everything here is within KPI. Our highest one is $11.99 which is like $12. All of these numbers are within KPI. So I’d highlight all of these and then what I’d do I would just mark them as yellow just so I know they’re in KPI. So these top ones are in KPI and if these bottom ones, they’re probably outside of KPI. What we can do is we can look at our cost per link click and we can see.

Now what we want to do is really just observe what is the DNA that is making up these top performing ad sets. This is when naming conventions come in handy. You see? So I can see the ad angle which is nine entrepreneurs jet and I can see that it’s fragment one. I can also see the name of the specific audience. So Tony Robbins, Ellen DeGeneres, Tony Robbins, Ellen DeGeneres, Zig Ziglar, [Power Pivot 01:00:40]. Now what you can see here is there’s also a copy and copy. That means that this is a duplicate. So you can see these top two performing ones are duplicates and then the next top two performing ones are the originals. So this is how I can tell by the DNA structure.

Remember I said you can see a DNA string? Well, look at it. You can just see it all lined up there. It’s perfect. I can tell just by the name what the history and genetic makeup of this thing is just by the name of it. We can really observe here and see what’s working and what’s not working. Over four day windows, you want to really decide to preserve the blue swans which are the performing ones and cull the nonperforming ones which are the ones which are out of KPI. So let’s assume all of these are out of KPI. So that is what we do. I’m going to go back to our instructions.

We want to update our Fb audiences, angles and images worksheet. So we go to this. As you can see, we’re going to have different audiences that we’ve got for testing deriving from our tower of Babel audience all the way through. So when we’re testing something, we want to have it … we want to copy these ones here into the testing stage when they are being tested. Then when we look at our data and we see whether they work or not, we want to either name them winner or let’s just say this one is not working or loser. We want to identify the winners and we also want to identify the losers. What this is, is just they’re within KPI or outside of KPI. We do that from looking really in here and identifying this.

An important thing that you might run into is that you might have one ad set that’s within KPI and you might have an ad set that’s outside of KPI but it’s for the same audience. If you come into that instance, then assume the best. So if one is in KPI, one is out, assume that that audience works. Always assume the best when you’re doing that. Same if one ad angle is in KPI, one ad angle is out of KPI, assume that that ad angle is good. It’s a winner. It only has to have one instance of winning within the current four day period for it to hold as a winner.

Then once we’ve identified things are winners and losers, we can describe them here and put them into proven and then put them into failed. This way we know what works and what doesn’t. This is important to have a record of. Then you’re probably going to have still a huge list here because you generated 30 audiences from your tower of Babel audience. So you’re still going to have a lot here. Like I said, you want to keep having that evergreen Garden of Eden. You want to keep moving things from within your ideas list into a testing list. Then when you get results from them, you want to move them into proven or failed. You’re constantly just shipping things through this from left to right forming ideas, testing it, getting the results and then saying, “Is it a winner or is it a loser? Proven or failed?”

This is what we’re constantly doing. We want to build this list here as big as possible. The more different audiences that we know are proven like from actual testing, the better. Also the more things we test and we know don’t work, the better because it’s going to stop us from doing that again. That’s why it’s important to save all of the stuff and keep track of it.

If we go back to our instructions, I also said that we had to update our angles. So here’s all of our angles and this is in the idea stage. Let’s just say I tested these two ad angles. So I take them out and I put them into the testing stage. Then when I’m testing them, I’m going to see which one works and which one doesn’t. Now let’s assume this one doesn’t work. It just had no instances of succeeding, not one ad set. So I’d take it from here and I’d move it to failed. Boom! Put it in.

Then let’s say this one was proven to work. I’d take it from here and I’d put it into proven. Boom! See? Now my testing workspace has cleared out. So when you’re testing space is cleared out, you want to check. Like, do you only have one ad angle in operation or do you have two? If you’ve got two, it’s okay. If you’ve only got one, that means you probably want to bring another one up for testing. So I’d go back to my angles ideas list and I’d grab the next one. I’d grab this, copy it over, bring it up for testing, drop it in here. Then I would go and launch this ad angle. Simple as that.

It’s important to keep this worksheet updated at all times so that we’ve got ideas ready to go for angles. We’re testing different angles. We’ve got proven angles and we know which angles we tried and failed as well. We’ve also got track of all of our different audiences. This sheet will just change your life completely. If you use it and if you’re disciplined and if you stick to our daily practice, discipline and workflow.

So we’ll go back. Then you want to turn off and delete all ad sets that are outside of KPI for CPL and CPSS when observed over four to seven day timeframes. So to do this we go to our Facebook ads manager. We want to make sure we’ve set this to last four days. We also want to check like last seven days. Then what we want to do is we want to export it. We’ll get the data like this. Then we want to find the ones that are working, highlight then yellow. To do that we sort by cost per lead, cost per value video opt-in and this should be within KPI. To find our KPIs, we get it from our paid attraction metric spreadsheet on the dashboard. Here’s our benchmark ranges.

So we go back in here. So let’s assume these things are outside of KPI. So I’m looking for nine entrepreneurs jet fragment one the book secret. So I grab that. Nine entrepreneurs jet fragment one secret the book, let’s just assume … what else? This is just a demo so just be with me while we do this. So nine entrepreneur jet fragment one lure of attraction. You want to be turning these things off. If you find something that’s outside of KPI when it comes to the value video opt-in or the cost per value video opt-in, but it’s within KPI for the actual survey, then you want to keep it. You want to keep it because cost per survey takes hierarchy over cost per opt-in. So always check that you’re not turning something off that’s actually generated a survey even if it has a really high cost per lead. Very important.

So you’d go through here. You’ll identify these different things. Let’s just say I identify that this is a red swan. This one is too. Let’s just say this and this one too. So I identify all of these as red swans because they were not producing leads, cost per value video opt-ins within KPI after a four day timeframe or the seven day timeframe.

So we first of all turn them off and they should go gray like that and say inactive. Then after we’ve really turned them off, you want to click on delivery here and you want to sort them just to make sure that you’ve got them all together. Then you want to do a thorough check just to make sure that you didn’t turn the right things off and that you didn’t mistake a red swan for a blue swan. After you’ve done your check, then you can just go and select here all the ones you turned off. You want to make sure that you’ve reported on this. Like if you found that one ad angle flopped and had no instances of winning, report on it in this sheet or if one audience had no instances of winning, report on it.

Then once you’ve reported on it, you double check that you didn’t make a mistake. Then you can just flush it out. You just go more, delete, boom, gone. Keep it clean. We don’t want anything in here. We don’t want any old stuff in here. We turn stuff off when we identify a red swan. Then we double check it, make sure we’ve reported on it and then we flush it out, get rid of it because we don’t want any clutter in here.

Then once we’ve done that, it says turn off all and delete all of these ad sets. Done. That’s step five. Now step six. Observe what ad sets you have left in your campaign, what their daily budgets are, what their CPL and CPSS’s and right now with what’s in your campaign, how many leads and surveys would you generate per day and per week? So what we want to do is have a look in here. Right now let’s say that I just select the day and I can see I’ve got a total of eight ad sets and if my budget is roughly like $10 a day that means I’m probably going to spend like $80 a day.

If my cost per value video opt-in is like $6, I can just do some quick math. I can go 80 divided by 7. That means that I’m going to get roughly 11 leads a day. Then if my cost per survey application is $66 and I’m spending $80, that means I’m going to get roughly one application a day.

Now I can determine if I just leave my campaign as is, those are sort of the numbers that I’m going to get. That like 12 opt-ins probably one survey application a day. So I want to think like, “Is that sufficient or is it not?” It probably isn’t. That’s probably nowhere near enough lead flow and strategy sessions to really make any decent money. You really want to be spending like $100, $150 in here.

So what we do in this case as we look at our instructions and right now with what’s in your budget how many leads and surveys would you generate per day and per week, I’ve already done that. Depending on your aspirations for scale and available daily budget, start propagating your healthiest blue swans through duplication and change the age by one year and change the budget at random to create micro variations.

So because I need some more here and I’m not really spending much, what I want to do is identify my absolute best performing swans. This one would definitely be one of my best performing ones because it’s got a survey application. Then this one here looks pretty good. It’s nice and cheap. So these two really I’m interested. These look like my healthiest judging on survey applications, cost per survey application, value video opt-ins and cost per value video opt-ins, right?

So what we do is to duplicate these. The best thing to do is to go ads manager power editor. Load this thing up. Then what we want to do is just make sure we don’t have anything in here. Discard changes. Then we want to select our cold traffic campaign, drill down into here and then what we want to do is we want to find those two that were the best performing which was … not sure I’m even going to be able to find it in here. Sometimes this happens. So that’s why it’s a good idea sometimes to have the ads manager and power editor up. So we select this one, drill down into the ad sets. Select the right columns, official tracking. I can see that we’ve got these. I’ve identified my two best which was this one and this one.

So first one nine entrepreneurs jet fragment one Tony Robbins or actually this is the best one, nine entrepreneurs jet fragment one Ellen DeGeneres. So we go into power editor. We select this one and what we do is we just go duplicate. We select existing campaign, put it in this one. Create new copies that are original, that are copies of the identical one. Set number of duplicates to two. Create.

So now that we’ve created these two, we can tell that they’re duplicates because they say in draft. We want to go along to the budget. Here it is. We just want to set this as something that’s not 10. We want to mix it up a bit and make it random. Let’s just go with 13 for this one and I’m just going to go 15 for this one. Now we want to go and duplicate this other winner which we had back here. So we’ve done Ellen DeGeneres.

Now we want to do this one fragment one Tony Robbins nine entrepreneurs jet. So we find this nine entrepreneurs jet fragment one Tony Robbins, there’s the one. We grab it. Then we go duplicate. Then we want to put it into our existing campaign, create a copy. Want to go for two, create. Now what you want to do is we can see these here. Want to come across and we want to edit the budget. We want to just make this bit random again. So I’m just going to 11 and we’re going to go this one with 12.

To do this, you just want to be like truly random. We’re just trying to fool the algorithm of it to make it think that it’s a different ad set. Now to do it … if we keep it identical like same age, same budget and same DNA structure, the algorithm might think that this is just an exact clone of something else and it will pull them together. We don’t want that. We want them to be separate. So that’s why we change the budgets. Sometimes you can change the age as well. There’s not a hard rule. You don’t have to change the age and budget for everything. You should change the budget for everything but 50% of the time you should change the age and 50% you don’t need to worry about it.

That might sound kind of random and that’s exactly the point. It is random. Like we’re just trying to literally have a little bit of random variation here so that we can just have different micro variations of healthy DNA here. So once we’ve got these four duplications ready to rock, we just go review changes, apply. Boom! We can see it’s uploading to Facebook. Here’s our progress timer up here.

What this will do is it will just duplicate the ad sets and publish them to Facebook. As easy as that. That’s how easy it is to propagate them. Then I can see this is done 100%. So now I want to go to my ads man- if I go back to my ads manager, I do a refresh here. I can see that these here new for pending review. They should get approved pretty quick. These are my duplications.

If I go and look at this, they’re called copy or copy two. This is how I know whether they’re duplicates of an original healthy DNA string. You can see I’ve got this full string here. That’s why having this full string and the proper naming conventions is vital so we can see the genetic makeup of the different blue swans.

So now we’ll go back here. So now we’ve done some duplicating. So now if I look back at my ads, I’ve got a total of 12 ad sets and I’m spending a total of $10 per ad sets or roughly that’s going to cost me about let’s just say $130. Now let’s say I’ve got about $200 in total just being on ads. I’d probably want to allocate this much budget towards running good ads and duplicating and all of that, but I’m also going to want to test some new stuff as well. A good rule of thumb to really operate by is I do have two ad angles that are running so I can see nine entrepreneurs, gee I’ve got advice for a consultants. Really, I’ve only got one ad angle running and I’ve only got this one running just one time.

So, if you have just only one ad angle running, that means that you need another ad angle because you always want to have at least two running. To figure out which one you want to go with, you can look in your Fb audiences, angles, images worksheet. You can go to angles and you can see what you’ve got in your testing list here. You want to choose the next one ready to go for testing.

You can also go to qwaya.com. Log in to your Qwaya account. Select your ad account and then you can go to targeting. So you want to click on ads and you want to click on use template. Then you can look at your different ads you’ve got. If you’ve only got one running right now in your Facebook account, then you might want to run your third one like this. Drag it in here. Boom! Then we go to set targeting. I’m going to flush this out. Now for targeting, you want to really be running at least like eight audience interest all the time. It’s good to have some variety in there. So we go back into our ads manager and we can look at our different audiences. I could count how many different audiences am I’m running.

Now if I’m only running four or I really want to be testing a bit more than that. I want to have at least two ad angles and at least eight audience interests in here just to have some healthy variation. So if I don’t have that many ad angles, I can go to my Fb audiences, angles, images. I can go to audiences and I can see what audience ideas I’ve got that I created from and derived from affinity from our tower of Babel which was Tony Robbins. So these have affinity to these so therefore they should be likely to work. So I can go and pluck an assortment of audience ideas here. Grab them, copy them here for testing. Then once I’ve done that, I can go to Qwaya. I can go to targeting. Then I can create another fragment.

To really create another fragment, you can just go like this. You duplicate the master audience. Then you rename the duplication of it and you call it fragment two because we’ve already got a fragment one. Now what you want to do is double click on the fragment two. You want to remove from here anything that is in fragment one. So remove anything from fragment one.

Now what you want to do is you want to remove anything which has been proven not to work. So you really want to edit these templates to remove the stuff that has been proven not to work. Really in here you should just have the eight that you’re ready to … the additional eight or the additional four or the additional however many you want to test. Just like that. Then you save it and then you can drag it in here. Boom.

Then you can go and test your new ad angle to these new fresh audiences. Boom. Then you can launch it. Then you can also launch the proven ad angles to these new audiences. That’s how we can go and launch additional variation so that we can always have at least two ad angles being tested and at least eight audience interests being tested here constantly looking for a nice variation in here. That’s why we call it the evergreen Garden of Eden. So that’s how that works.

So now if we go back to our instructions here. This is the daily workflow of the king completed. Like I said it’s available for download as a cheat sheet beneath this video in the resources section as is the reporting on real Facebook data as well. You want to print this workflow out as well as this so that when you’re doing it every morning, you just follow through and you just complete it. If you run into any issues, we’ve got the troubleshooting guide available here as well. So you can really just figure out exactly what’s going on, identify the root cause of the issue, solve it and you’re good.

So now we’re going to discuss solving chaos in the kingdom. This is how to protect your blue swan empire. So when managing your Facebook ads, the last thing you want to do is cause too much chaos. The second to last thing you want to do is cause no chaos at all. The best strategy for this is to always have a healthy amount of chaos so that you can handle and determine cause and effect relationships. To do this, you always iterate one variable of three. For example, ads, funnel, script or message, angle, image. I covered this earlier in this module.

So I said if you were to iterate one of these variables, you‘ve got your Facebook ads campaign then you’ve got your funnel, your fragmentation funnel then you’ve got your cell script. If you identified that your ads was the weak link in this string, well you’d be testing different iterations on your ads, but you wouldn’t want to change your funnel or your script. You got to keep two constant, iterate one. However, if you identified your funnel as the weak link, you’d hold your ads constant. You’d hold your script constant. You’d just iterate this. If you identified your sales script because your call conversion was low, you’d hold these two constant. You’d iterate this one. That’s how we do it. Hold two constant, iterate one. We need to know what is cause and what is effect.

If we were to test within ads, we’d try and hold … if we identified … This is a mistake here. Sorry. It should say audience, angle, image or angle, audience, image, right? So you’d iterate just the audience or just the angle or just the image. You’d hold two constant, iterate one. That’s how you do it. By iterating one variable, we are creating chaos and feeding off of it to find a better option. The only way to find something better is to experience some chaos.

Chaos is basically uncertainty. It’s by trying something which we don’t know. It’s really testing, trying something new. That means chaos but is really good provided we can determine cause and effect. When it works, we know why and if it doesn’t work, we know why. When we iterate two variables, we lose track of that. This is only possible when you iterate one variable. Otherwise, you won’t know what’s cause and effect. If you have any issues with your Facebook ads or funnel, you can refer to the troubleshooting Facebook ads cheat sheet. I’ve shown you that. It’s available for download in the resources section beneath this video.

Now here’s three vital tips for really solving chaos. Vital tip number one is all ads must experience four full days before they reveal their true nature in KPIs. During this incubation period you cannot touch them. Always remember to give them enough time. If you’re really analyzing your ads after 24 hours or god forbid less than 24 hours, then you just have no idea what you’re doing. You might as well grab your money, pour some gas on it and just light on fire. Seriously, that’s probably a better option than this. So you just can’t do that. You want to give them four days and then you want to let them reveal their true nature and then judge them and scale them based on that.

Vital tip number two. If the Polaris star which is ROI is within KPI, nothing else matters. So if we’re paying … I always say this. If we’re paying $1,000 a click and $1,000 per lead and $1,000 per strategy session, that doesn’t matter if every single strategy session we have buys because that’s fine. So when the Polaris star is fine, is in alignment, we don’t care about any of our other metrics. All of our other metrics can be out of KPI provided the Polaris star is in KPI. You always judge KPIs from their hierarchy position from the top down. So start with ROI, then cost per acquisition, cost per strategy session, cost per survey. You work your way down until you get into CPC, CTR, all of that stuff. You always start by judging KPIs from the top down.

Vital tip number three. When observing KPIs, understand all KPIs beneath it reflect into it. All KPIs are interconnected and none of them are isolated instances. Now this is huge. So many people don’t know this. They operate Facebook as if it’s a machine is built up of isolated instances like their CPC is totally disconnected from their cost per acquisition and everything. So people try and just absolutely get the cheapest CPC or the cheapest CPL and they don’t have any idea what that’s doing to their profits. Now all things are connected. All of them.

So whenever we’re looking at KPIs, we’re looking at all of them. Then only if the top ones are out do we drill down to the smaller ones. If we’re attempting to fix an individual KPI, we never stop observing all of the other ones. Let’s say our cost per click is $4. That’s out of KPI. Then let’s say we’re iterating different things to try and get it within KPI. Then let’s say we bring it from $4 to $3 but in doing that our cost per strategy session goes up from $60 to $100. How the hell did that happen? I mean we just made our cost per click cheaper, how on earth did our cost per strategy session get more expensive? That’s what I mean. We got to watch out for that stuff. That’s what no one else can see. Sometimes you can get one metric down and blow up another one.

I once was experimenting with my landing page. I improved it by 12%. It was at 25% and I got it to 37%. I was like, “Oh my God this is going to make so much more money.” My entire campaign broke. I kid you not. I improved my landing page conversion by 12%. I killed it. It was no longer even profitable. You’ve got to watch out for that stuff. We’re always attempting to just fix one KPI but we can never take our eye off all of them. You have to understand that all of these things are interconnected and it’s so, so, so important that you know that. You’re not just really just zooming in and getting tunnel vision on one KPI and obsessing about it. All of them are interconnected and we judge them from the top one, the Polaris star, down. Provided the Polaris star is in, the others don’t matter too much.

So that is it for this training video on the daily workflow of the king. So throughout this module, I’ve shown you exactly how to manage an effective Facebook campaign day in, day out and you just want to stick to that daily workflow. You want to make sure you’re reporting on real data, make sure you’re organized, disciplined. Make sure you report every single day. Make sure you report on yesterday’s data. If you have any issues at all, just keep a cool, calm head. Stay in the analytical mind and use our troubleshooting worksheet to identify the cause, drill down and fix it. So that’s it for this training module. Thanks for watching and I’ll see you in the next one right now.
