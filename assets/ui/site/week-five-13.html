                        Hey, everyone. It&#039;s Sam Ovens here and welcome to the final training module in this week five Facebook training. This one is called Ratcheting Up the Kingdom. What we&#039;re going to talk about in this module is basically how to scale your campaigns up, like how to really crank things up and really crank up the ad spend, crank up the amount of leads you&#039;re able to get, the amount of strategy session applications and the amount of customers and ultimately, the amount of money and profit that you&#039;re able to make. And when I say scale up, I really mean fucking scaling it right up, like up. I&#039;ve scaled my campaigns up around $30,000 a day and held them there for seriously long amounts of time.

I&#039;ve spent millions of dollars on Facebook ads, and I spend more on ads myself than agencies spend on all of their clients combined. And so if there&#039;s one thing I know a lot about when it comes to Facebook ads, it&#039;s scaling. In this module, I&#039;m really going to just pull back the curtain and really just reveal to you some of the best methods and tactics and strategies that there is when it comes to scaling Facebook ads. So this is going to be an awesome module, and I can&#039;t wait to share this information with you. Let&#039;s get to it.

So here&#039;s what we&#039;re going to cover on today&#039;s training. We&#039;re going to start off by discussing how to unlock Facebook&#039;s algorithm and to do this, you really need to understand tranches of traffic. You really need to know what tranches are, how they work, and how you can really utilize them to cut into and splice into all different angles of an audience and maximize the reach that you can get, and this is a huge lesson. Then we&#039;re going to discuss building your one million person audience, so I&#039;m going to tell you why you need it, why it&#039;s important, and how to go about getting it for yourself. Then I will explain the strategy and I&#039;m even going to explain the step by step process and workflows that you can actually go about building your own one million person audience.

This really is the ultimate luxury when it comes to Facebook advertising because it basically means that you can spend up to a thousand dollars a day on ads and do not have to worry about frequency issues, you don&#039;t have to worry about burning out your audience, and you also don&#039;t have to worry about testing lots of different audience interest because when you have a million person audience, you can really just advertise to that again and again with up to a grand a day in ad spend and you&#039;re good. And so for a lot of people, a grand a day in ad spend, you can be making 200 grand a month or more off that if you&#039;ve set everything up correctly. So this can be a huge lesson.

Then we&#039;re going to discuss the holy grail of scale, and this is four methods for an absolute and complete market takeover. I&#039;m going to explain what these four methods are, how they work, and how you can deploy them yourself immediately from this training which I&#039;m going to show you today. Then we&#039;re going to discuss Archimedes lever and financial engineering to displace the earth. Archimedes lever is basically a method and a strategy that I&#039;ve got when it comes to financial engineering with Facebook.

This is one area where I really have an edge on other people when it comes to Facebook and business and everything because most people, they&#039;re just talking about marketing and they&#039;re just all about Facebook or funnels or all of this stuff. But if you understand finance and if you understand how to engineer your finance and your cash flows properly, well you can just run laps around all marketers and it&#039;s an extremely powerful method and I&#039;m going to explain how it works to you in this module today and I&#039;ll explain how you can use financial engineering yourself. And it really is one of my secret weapons.

Then we&#039;re going to discuss how you can learn to see the matrix and bet big. This is when you just develop like a sixth sense when it comes to Facebook advertising, funnels, numbers, and all of that. It&#039;s like you can just sense things and you know really what to do and what to change and it&#039;s like you can start doing the stuff without even really thinking about it. That&#039;s when you really get good. That&#039;s when you can get into the zone. It&#039;s like the numbers are talking to you and that&#039;s when you can really start scaling and you can start to see cause and effect relationships.

When you get into that state, if you can evolve and get to that level, then you are going to be just an absolute animal in your marketplace. You&#039;re going to eat everything there is and more. And so this is a huge, huge thing to achieve when you can see the matrix and really know when to bet big. We&#039;re going to explain all of this stuff and if you can really understand all of this stuff and if you can really implement it in your business, then you&#039;re going to be able to take your business to great heights. So I&#039;m really looking forward to sharing this information with you, so let&#039;s get started.

At this stage of the Facebook training, you should have launched your ads and completed your judgment day and you should be in your daily routine of Facebook management and you should be completing the daily workflow of a king, which was the previous module, and you should be doing that day to day and managing your ads and looking after everything. Now you know how to create, launch, test, and manage successful Facebook campaigns and that&#039;s an awesome achievement so congratulations on that. So what&#039;s left to learn? I mean if we know all of that stuff, we&#039;ve covered a lot of ground at week five, what&#039;s there left to learn? What&#039;s left to do?

Well now, the only thing left to do is to take over the entire world, so let&#039;s get it done. Unlocking Facebook&#039;s algorithm: Understanding tranches of traffic. Here&#039;s where most people go wrong with Facebook and this is the causal chain of Facebook advertising failure and by causal chain, I mean this is the exact sequence of events that happens when someone&#039;s Facebook ads die. It&#039;s not always the case because obviously, some people are a bit better at advertising than others but I&#039;d say for 99% of the population, this is what happens with them.

Number one, they set a laser targeted audience of 10,000 people or near abouts who they believe are a perfect fit, that laser target audience with lots of layering, all sorts of different things on it like a hundred K income, likes this person and that person, but doesn&#039;t like this person. You know what I mean, really crazy, hyper targeting. And then the audience sees the ad on days one and two and some people click on the ad and the advertiser gets results. They&#039;re like, &quot;Oh, yes. This is working. I knew I should&#039;ve gone for this laser target audience. I&#039;m getting clicks. It&#039;s working.&quot;

But then day three comes around and by day three, the algorithm has really clamped down on a subsegment of the 10,000 person audience and now, it&#039;s really only reaching a thousand. While the audience is set at 10,000, it&#039;s only reaching 1,000. So now 1,000 people are seeing the ad and there&#039;s only one of them and with any level of budget, so the advertiser could really have any level of budget from $30,000 to a hundred dollars, with any level of budget, if you&#039;ve only got a thousand-person reach in one ad, well you&#039;re going to force Facebook to show the ad multiple times per person. So these thousand people are going to see this ad multiple times. They might see it four, five, six times in one day and they&#039;re going to see it day after day.

Then what&#039;s going to happen is people are going to become numb to the ad since they&#039;ve seen it so many times already, so they&#039;re going to stop clicking on it. Then when people stopped clicking on it, the CTR which is your click through rate is going to decrease. And when your CTR decreases, it&#039;s going to directly increase your CPC which is your cost per click. This trend is going to continue at an ever accelerating rate. Once it starts trending, once that CTR starts dipping, well then CPC&#039;s going to start hiking and it&#039;s going to go faster and faster and faster. As soon as that frequency goes over two and up to three, it&#039;s going to start ... Frequency really is the trigger for CTR and CTR really is the trigger for CPC. These things are all tied together in a causal chain.

Then what&#039;s going to happen is seven, the CPC is going to increase and it&#039;s going to keep increasing until Facebook can no longer serve their traffic at a price that will satisfy your adset&#039;s daily budgets. Facebook&#039;s going to keep giving you traffic but your CPC&#039;s going to go up and then Facebook&#039;s algorithm is going to look at your daily adset budget and how much it&#039;s costing you per click and it&#039;s just going to be like it no longer makes sense to deliver traffic to this advertiser. The numbers aren&#039;t just adding up. When Facebook&#039;s algorithm determines that, which will be very quickly, the Facebook algorithm is going to give your or the advertiser&#039;s position and the impressions pecking order to another advertiser whose ads work better.

So as soon as your numbers start to go out of whack, Facebook&#039;s algorithm is going to look over all the other advertisers that want to reach this audience and it&#039;s going to see if any of their CTRs are higher and any of their CPCs are in a safer range. If the answer is true or yes, then what it&#039;s going to do is it&#039;s going to divert all the traffic that you were getting, all of it to the other advertiser and it&#039;s going to no longer serve you any traffic. So then the advertiser is going to stop receiving traffic completely. The other scenario that could happen is they will still get traffic, but their CPC is going to so high that it no longer makes sense to advertise, and then the advertiser is going to bail out or turn off their ads. But more common, we often see just the advertiser just ceases to get traffic completely.

What&#039;s crazy is why this might seen like a lot of stuff, all of this happens within three to four days. This is how quick it happens when you set things up the wrong way. Within three to four days, these things happen in a causal chain and then the advertisers are like, &quot;Hmm, well the ad must just be tired. So I&#039;ll refresh the creative,&quot; and then they just repeat the process over again and then they go back to step one and they go through the sequence again, and they just keep going through it again and again. It&#039;s like really just like a cow just walking into a wall and then just walking away and just walking back into it again. That&#039;s really how stupid it is. This is really what happens to most people and this is not what we want to do when it comes to Facebook advertising, obviously.

So what&#039;s the solution? Well first, you must understand tranches of traffic. This is the best way I can describe a tranche. Imagine we&#039;ve got this circle here and this is our total audience size. Then say I select the Tony Robbins audience and let&#039;s just say for this example purpose that Tony Robbins audience has 500,000 people in it. Here&#039;s the audience, 500,000 people. Then my ad is going to experience initial conditions and by initial conditions, I mean some people are going to click on the ad and some people are going to opt in, some people are going to comment, like, do different things like this.

Now based off the initial people that clicked, like, opt in, comment, do all of that stuff, Facebook&#039;s going to look at them and then say who else within this audience of 500,000 looks like these people that are taking action on this ad? Then very quickly, what Facebook&#039;s going to do is it&#039;s going to start optimizing to just show the ads to other people within this audience that look like the people who are already taking action. This is what we call a tranche and a tranche really is just like a slice, so just imagine it like a slice of cake or something.

So we have this initial audience of 500,000 people and then by the time initial conditions set in which can happen really within the first day but really for them to sit nicely into place, it&#039;s going to take four days. Once those initial conditions set in for a particular adset, what the algorithm has done is cut us a tranche within that original 500-person audience. While it looks like we are targeting 500,000 people, our true authentic reach is probably only really like a hundred thousand people or less. So while it appears that we are targeting 500,000, we are only really targeting 100,000 but it&#039;s actually way less than that as well, which you&#039;re about to learn.

And then, Facebook cuts another tranche. This time, it&#039;s like a circle in the middle of it. This is called a budget affinity tranche. So first of all, what Facebook is doing is it&#039;s really looking at the initial conditions and then it&#039;s really cutting a tranche in the audience. But then it&#039;s also looking at how much budget we have set and based on the budget, it&#039;s going to cut like a circle around the middle here. This really determines what segment of the initial conditions tranche that we&#039;re actually going to show out, that Facebook&#039;s actually going to show our ad to.

This really brings our true reach, our true authentic reach down from a hundred thousand people to 10,000 people. You can see on the top right hand side of the screen, the number&#039;s decreasing here. We went from 500,000 to 100,000 to 10,000 people pretty quick and all of this happened really without us knowing because if we look at our audience targeting, it still says 500,000. So you can see how people make these mistakes and most people truly think they&#039;re targeting 500,000 people but they&#039;re really targeting 10,000 people of that 500,000-person audience.

The sell segments in the middle here which you can see with the red arrow, this is what you&#039;re really targeting. This happens when we cut these two tranches. First of all, the initial conditions tranche and then second of all, the budget affinity tranche. So it goes slice, slice. The only piece really of the audience that we&#039;re getting is this middle piece in here. What do most people do? Well, they hike the budget and this is a big mistake. Oh, dear.

So here&#039;s what happens when you just hike a budget on an adset. This is when you just go into a Facebook ad and you see an adset that you think is working so get it the budget. That is not what you want to do, last thing you want to do. Here&#039;s what actually happens. So this is the tranche of traffic that you&#039;re getting originally. You&#039;ve got initial conditions that are happening and here&#039;s your tranche based on your budget. Well, when you increase your budget, each time that you hike your budget on an adset, you&#039;re venturing into tranches of traffic with less and less affinity to the initial conditions suitable to that particular adset.

When you first created that adset, it had some different variables in it, it had some images, it had audience, and it also had an ad angle. But it also had something else and that was the initial conditions. Based on the people who interacted with it, Facebook&#039;s algorithm went and cut this initial condition&#039;s tranche for your particular ad and its adset. What was also involved and setting that tranche was the budget. But now, what happens when you hike that budget is it really cuts out another tranche which is wider. So it&#039;s not really going to give you more reach around the audience. It&#039;s just going to give you deeper traffic within that initial conditions tranche. Every time you&#039;ve already got initial conditions set and then you hike the budget like that, well you&#039;re just venturing into worse and worse traffic.

So it&#039;s like if an adset&#039;s working really well at 10 bucks and now we hike it to 20, then 30, then 40, then 50, then 60, it&#039;s like every time we do that, we&#039;re just venturing deeper and deeper into bad traffic, like we&#039;re getting further and further away from the initial conditions that were relevant to this particular adset. Let&#039;s say we hike it again. Each time you hike your budget, you just keep venturing in here and you just keep cutting these tranches out until you get right out into the traffic that really has hardly any affinity to the initial conditions that were suitable for your particular adset.

Again, what is the solution? Well instead of scaling budget and venturing into tranches with less affinity to initial conditions, we take the DNA of a successful adset and we duplicate it so that we can get new initial conditions within that same total audience. If we&#039;ve got this total audience here, instead of hiking budget and cutting out those other circles and really going into those other tranches. We duplicate it. We duplicate a successful ad and when we do that, we create brand new initial conditions. So now what&#039;s going to happen is a brand new initial conditions tranche is going to be set and cut into the audience with that particular audience.

And so instead of going deeper and deeper into traffic that really isn&#039;t suitable, we&#039;re slicing around within this audience and we&#039;re getting new unique reach with each new tranche we slice. So we keep creating new initial conditions tranches within the total audience size by duplication. You can see here, we just keep cutting around and we keep going around. Then what we do is once we&#039;ve cut enough around like that, we didn&#039;t start experimenting with new initial conditions tranches that are programmed for high budgets from day one. When you do want to start hiking budgets, you don&#039;t select an adset and then increase its budget. You set the budget high from the very beginning because budget itself is part of the initial conditions.

When Facebook&#039;s algorithm is optimized in all of these different variables, one of the key variables in there is budget. If you have a low budget at the beginning, well Facebook&#039;s going to be optimizing all the variables for a low budget. Then if you go and change the budget, well now you&#039;ve just messed all the variables up. So if you do want to have high budgets per adset, absolutely nothing wrong with that but you got to do it from day one.

What you can start doing is you can duplicate a winning adset that ... Let&#039;s say it&#039;s at $10. When you duplicate it, you&#039;re giving it brand new initial conditions. Now what you want to do is you want to set the budget for that at like say a hundred bucks or fifty bucks or whatever. You can start hiking the budget that way and you launch it with a high budget so that when it&#039;s in its four-day incubation period, that Garden of Eden period, it&#039;s working to optimize for the high budget. It is so important that the high budget exists within the first four-day incubation period for the adset to really take shape and evolve correctly.

If we change it after that, if I make an analogy or a metaphor for it, it&#039;s like you&#039;re training someone for a marathon. Those are the initial conditions. And then you&#039;re like, &quot;Oh, actually, well you should be a heavy weightlifter,&quot; and just changing it like that. The person has evolved for a particular type of exercise and environment and now you&#039;re just throwing them into something totally different. This is what happens when you have an adset that&#039;s really evolved for low budgets and then you just throw a high budget. You want to evolve the adset for the high budget from the very beginning.

We do this by cutting new tranches and then we cut out bigger budgets for those new tranches and then we start to venture deeper in it to the circle here. So not only are we going around in a circle, we&#039;re also going out and you can see how we&#039;re starting to cut into all of these different areas. We keep duplicating new initial conditions tranches that are programmed for high budgets from day one, and we just keep cutting them around. Eventually, we cut through as much of the target audience as possible through different tranches with different initial conditions and budgets.

And so you can see how originally, we might&#039;ve only ... We had a 500,000-person audience but by the way the initial conditions trache was cut and then the budget affinity tranche was cut, we only really ended up with a true unique reach of about 10,000 people. But if we keep duplicating it and really cutting it this way, the right way, well we can end up getting a reach as high as about 400,000 people on a 500,000-person audience. We can really hack it and we can really cut and slice multiple different ways into this audience instead of trying to do it the way everyone else does which is just put one little slice in it and then hike the budget and venture into just absolutely rubbish traffic.

The way you want to think about is just think of it like the ... Think of tranches as age rings within the trunk of a tree. Here&#039;s a tree trunk, if you slice it open, it looks like this. Well each time you hike your budget, you venture out in these tranches and each time you see its new initial conditions, you venture into a new slice of the pie. Think about initial conditions as slices of pizza around this thing and then think of these different age rings as increasing the budget. That&#039;s how you&#039;re slicing into that overall audience size.

Here&#039;s what I&#039;ve observed after spending a few million bucks on Facebook ads. A budget and the budget tranche it creates is itself a part of the initial conditions. When you experience initial conditions on an adset, budget is a part of that. Budget really is one of the variables in there. And so when something works with its initial conditions, you just don&#039;t go and change one of them rapidly because it&#039;s probably going to have a crazy effect. What we typically see happen and what I&#039;m sure a lot of advertisers have seen happen if you&#039;ve been advertising on Facebook and you&#039;re watching this video, well if you change the budget on an adset, well you&#039;re going to change the initial conditions and you&#039;re going to get a butterfly effect consequence. What a butterfly effect consequence is is you&#039;re making a small change, but you&#039;re going to get a absolutely huge effect.

Let&#039;s say I&#039;ve got a proven ad and it&#039;s working and all you do is hike the budget by 10 bucks, you&#039;d expect it to just work better. But instead what ends up happening is it just stops working altogether. So by trying to scale something, you just killed the whole thing. It&#039;s like by trying to just spend more, the whole thing just dies. Well that&#039;s the sort of effect that you get when you mess with initial conditions like that, so we call it butterfly effect.

In that early stages of scaling, you want to scale with initial conditions tranches through duplication. What we mean by this is in the early stages of scaling your ads, you first of all just want to be creating duplicates but keeping the budgets nice and low. While scaling the initial conditions tranches, hold adset budgets lower to preserve that budget affinity. It&#039;s best to get multiple different slices through the audience with low budgets first. Then once you&#039;ve scaled with initial conditions tranches, you can now experiment with larger budgets and you want to create new initial conditions tranches but set adset budgets higher to venture deeper into the audience.

For example, if you had all 10 to 14 to $15 adsets, well now you could try a $100 adset, just a duplication of one of the $10 ones. That way, you&#039;re going to really start resetting the initial conditions but in a brand new tranche which is good and you&#039;re venturing deeper into the audience as well. So it&#039;s a way to cut lots of different slices into an audience to reach it from lots of different ways so that we can maximize our true reach. To do any of this, you need an audience size of at least 500,000 people and really, it should be more like one million people. I&#039;m going to say in this training video, it should be a million-person audience but if you do get yours up to 500,000 and you just can&#039;t manage to get it any higher than that, then that&#039;s okay, 500,000 will do. But really, we&#039;re aiming for a million.

So how do we get an audience of one million people? Well, here&#039;s how we do it. Building your one million person audience. In order to cut multiple tranches into an audience and experience maximum reach, the audience size must be significant to begin with and this is for obvious reasons. Obviously, you can&#039;t have an audience size of 10,000 and cut a ton of tranches into that because it ... It&#039;s like if you have a small pizza, you just can&#039;t cut all the slices into it. It doesn&#039;t really work like that. The audience size must be significant to begin with if we want to deploy the strategy. And it really should be 500,000 to a million people big.

Now you&#039;re probably thinking why. Well as a general rule, you can spend up to $10 per day per 10,000 people in an audience. For example, if you have an audience that is 100,000 people big, then you can spend $100 per day max. The rule is $10 per day ad spend per 10,000 people in an audience. So if it&#039;s a hundred thousand people, you can spend a hundred bucks. It&#039;s a dollar per 1,000. If you go over this ratio of $10 per day per 10,000 people in an audience, you will spike the frequency and trigger an avalanche. Like I said in that previous example, the causal chain of most Facebook failure.

Well, when people hike the budgets on their ads, they&#039;re going to be showing those ads a lot of times to a small group of people. When that happens, the small group of people stops clicking on the ad because they&#039;re seeing it too many times. As soon as your frequency goes up which is the amount of time the people see it, as soon as that just spikes up a little bit, click through rate goes down, cost per click goes through the roof, and you&#039;re out. This really does trigger an avalanche when you go past this rule so you really want to stick to this ratio, $10 per day per 10,000 people in an audience.

And because of this $10 per day per 10,000 people rule, your first obstacle with scaling will probably be the size of your audience. For example, if you have an audience size of 200,000 people and a daily ad spend of $200, this means you&#039;re already scaled to 100% of your potential and you can&#039;t scale anymore because you are at max. If you try to scale more, you will trigger an avalanche and destroy all of your ads. You need to grow that audience. You can never really go past this $10 per day per 10,000 people rule. It&#039;s really important.

Therefore, based on this, the first step of scaling Facebook ads is to build a proven audience of 500,000 to a million people. In this way, you can scale your daily ad spend up to $1,000 a day and never have to worry about frequency and fatigue issues. If we&#039;re at a thousand dollars a day and if it&#039;s $10 per day per 10,000 people, that means we can now spend ... We can spend a thousand dollars a day if we have a one million person audience. That&#039;s how it works. And most people, really if they&#039;re not going go up to a thousand dollars a day because that&#039;s quite a lot of ad spend. When you&#039;re at the thousand dollars a day ad spend range, that&#039;s when you&#039;re starting to make $100,000 a month, 200,000 and the highest I&#039;ve really seen someone get to on a thousand dollars a day is about $300,000 a month. That&#039;s big money. That&#039;s why getting this one million person audience is really a first step to scaling.

Here&#039;s how you build your one million person audience. To build an audience of 500,000 to a million people, you first start by testing individual audience interests like we did previously in the other modules. We test out lots of different audiences. We hypothesize about what audiences are going to win based off the affinity to audiences that we know we have won in the past or our Tower of Babel audience. Then we test and we find out which ones work and we find out which ones don&#039;t work. Then what we do is we update our Facebook audiences, angles, and images worksheet with the interests that do and don&#039;t work and we keep testing new ones into the total audience size as 500,000 people. You can check the total size within Qwaya&#039;s template.

Within Qwaya, you can double click on your particular targeting template and it will show you all of your different audience interest and it will tell you the total size of it. You really want that total size to be 500,000 to a million and you want all of those audience interest within that targeting template to have been individually tested as split audiences and now, they&#039;re within this one template. You don&#039;t want a single one in there to have not been tested that defeats this entire purpose.

So as soon as you&#039;ve got a proven audience size of 500,000 to a million people that has been tested, it&#039;s time to combine all audience interests into something called a pooled audience and to do this, we turn the split feature in Qwaya off. I&#039;m going to show you how this works right now. If I go to Qwaya.com and if I log in to my account and if I go to set targeting, and if I see here my audience interests group here. Let&#039;s just say I&#039;m using fragment 1. If I double click on this, within here, I can see all of my different audiences and I can see the combined total of them is 24 million. This is rare. This is just because these are such huge audiences but typically, this is going to be a lot lower.

And so really, what you want to see is that this number here is at least one million and you should have tested all of these individual ones on their own and they should be proven audience interests and you should have them in your FB angles, audiences, and images worksheet. You should have these all marked as tested winners. Once you have enough tested winners in here so that this size here says that it&#039;s at least 500,000 to a million, well you see how this is split here. Well what happens right now is if we drag this in here, you can see it splits it into eight different adsets. And when I launch ads here, this is going to go into eight different adsets. Now, watch what happens if I flush this out and then if I go back here and this time, I remove split. This time I go save.

All right, so now that I&#039;ve removed split, remember it used to be eight before. Now I&#039;m going to drag this in and now you can see, it&#039;s just one. When we remove the split feature, it combines all different audience interests into one big audience just like that. This pulls together all specific audience interests that have been proven as individual paths and most of the time, the sum of the individual paths works better than the individual paths on their own. So if we were to take all of the different audience interests, all those split out different adsets and if we would add up the results we&#039;re getting from them all as separate paths, we would not get the same sum as if we added them all together as one. When the things are together as one, it usually equals way better results. It also removes a ton of complexity for us. It removes a lot of different adsets out of our campaigns and it makes it a lot easier to advertise.

Now when you go to launch ads with Qwaya, the audience will appear as one adset instead of a collection of adsets. And the individual audience interests are now pulled into one, and this is important, extremely important. When you start testing your pooled audience, don&#039;t turn off your split audience adsets until your pooled audience adsets start outperforming them. So what I mean by this is if I go and I launch that pooled audience adset and I&#039;ve got a whole bunch of split audience adsets already in my ad account, if all the split ones are performing well, I&#039;m not going to go in a hurry and go and delete them all and then just push this new one out. No, no, no.

We push the new pooled one out and we let it run in parallel with all of our splits and only once the pooled audience has well outperformed the split audiences do we start to turn them off. And only do we begin it to wean off split audience adsets once our pooled audience adset has been proven. I&#039;m pretty sure you get what I mean but this is important. If anything&#039;s working, we turn it off because we think something else is going to work better. We leave it on until we know for sure that this other thing is working better because we always want to hedge our risk. Once you&#039;ve got your 500,000 to one million person audience ready, it&#039;s time to go big and this next section is called the holy grail of scale: Four methods for a complete takeover.

When it comes to scaling, there&#039;s four moves that are devastatingly powerful and you&#039;re about to learn all of them, so let&#039;s get to work. It&#039;s the holy grail of scale, four methods for domination. Method number one is to grow the size of your pooled audience. The first method of scaling is simple, keep testing individual audience interests that have affinity to your proven audience interests and when proven, add them to your pooled audience template. As this grows, you can create more adsets hitting tranches and spend more.

What I mean by this is you want to go into your FB audiences, angles, images worksheet, you want to look at your different audience interests, and you want to look at your ideas column. Based on your ideas column, you&#039;re going to come up with new audience interests which you can target, and you can come up with more by just looking at what audience interests are working and then using the audience builder tool within Facebook to look at what audiences have affinity to the ones that are working, and you can come up with a never ending list. It never ends. You can go for years just creating different ones.

So no one can ever come up with the excuse that they can&#039;t find more audience interests. There&#039;s an infinite supply of them and there&#039;s a tool that actually tells you which ones to pick. When you pick new ones, you put them into a spreadsheet in the ideas column, and then what you do is you come in here and you create a new folder or a new fragment and you add in all of your new audience interests here and you run this as split first. And then what you do is you come in here, you launch this, you launch your ads, and then you test. You&#039;re testing new audience interests here and you just want to keep testing new audience interests until you&#039;re really growing up your size of audiences that are proven winners. The bigger that pooled audience that you grow gets, the more tranches you can cut in that and the more ad spend you can spend.

Now you only really want to grow your audience, your pooled audience if your ad spend is starting to get to its limits. We know it&#039;s getting to its limits based on the rule that is $10 per 10,000 people. Let&#039;s say you&#039;ve got an audience and it&#039;s got 500,000 people in it. Well, that means you can spend up to $500 a day on it. So if you&#039;re getting up to about $400 a day in ad spend and your audience size is only 500,000, then you probably want to start testing new audience interests, finding out what works and what doesn&#039;t and adding the ones that work into your pooled audience and starting to grow its size because you can&#039;t spend more unless that audience size gets bigger, too.

Then method two, propagating healthy blue swans. The second method of scaling is when we propagate our fittest blue swans by duplicating them and changing the age by one year and the budget randomly. You want to start by keeping the budgets lower and then experiment with higher budgets and always keep it random for variation. So this is what we discussed before when we were talking about different tranches and propagating different swans. As we start duplicating adsets that work, well we want to start off by just duplicating and keeping the budgets low and then once those start to work, we want to start duplicating them but starting to make the budgets higher. That&#039;s what we call propagating healthy blue swans, and it&#039;s a way to cut new tranches into our big pooled audience.

But before we go and cut different tranches into it, we have to have a big audience to begin with. So method one always comes before method two. And if we keep using method two and we keep spending more, then it will eventually come to a point where we have to come back to method one and start growing the size of the entire pie because just like with a small pie, you can only cut so many slices into it. And once you&#039;ve cut so many slices, you have to start making the pie bigger too to be able to cut more, and that&#039;s how that works.

Then method number three, splicing healthy blue swan DNA. The third method of scaling is when we find our fittest blue swans and we splice their DNA of audience-message-image by iterating one variable. This creates offshoots of the original DNA and we can create variation as well as improve the DNA. What you want to do is iterate image, message, and then audience in that order typically. This is the lowest risk sequence to test things. If you&#039;ve got a proven adset, you want to look at its DNA makeup and it should contain an audience message and an image.

Well, the first thing to test is just changing the image. Duplicate it but change the different images in it and you&#039;ll be surprised. You&#039;ll probably be able to create a better offshoot, a better performing offshoot of the original blue swan. Or if you don&#039;t create better ones, you might create ones that are on par with it and by doing this, we&#039;re really splicing the DNA. We&#039;re really taking a proven healthy DNA string and we&#039;re leaving two things constant where we&#039;re just splicing something in on that third combinator there.

Once we&#039;ve tried different images, then we can try taking those healthy strings and then we can try a different message but we can keep image in the audience the same. We hold audience constant, we hold image constant, but we change out the messaging and the angle. Then once we&#039;ve tried that, we can try keeping message and image constant but just trying different audiences and this works really well. This is what we call splicing healthy blue swan DNA.

Then there&#039;s method number four, just creating lookalike audiences. The fourth method of scaling is only possible if you have 1,000 or more conversion fires on your value video optins pixel. Once you have greater than 1,000 conversions, the algorithm has enough intelligence to genetically engineer an audience that has close affinity to the people who convert it. This is extremely powerful and I&#039;ll show you how you can do this. All you need to do is you can come into your business manager, you can launch your Facebook ads account, and then what you can do is you can go to your audiences and then we can see our different audiences here.

Now the people who opted in are going to be the people who are ... They are the people who visited VV but no survey. If someone visited VV but no survey, it basically means that they&#039;ve opted in because the only way to view the VV which is the value video is through opting in. Now if they&#039;ve opted in, it means that we&#039;ve got ... They&#039;re the right sort of people we want. You can see, we&#039;ve got 30 of these so roughly 60 people came to our landing page and of those 60, 30 of them opted in and so of these 30 here, we can click here and then we can click on actions and then we can click create lookalike. Now you&#039;d only ever want to do this once this is over a thousand because right now with only 30, the algorithm&#039;s got no idea. If we&#039;re creating a lookalike off this, again, it might just be ... It probably is smarter to just grab your money and just set it on fire. Not even joking. No exaggeration. This has to be up at like a thousand. The higher, the better.

Now just to give you some perspective. I have about 750 to 800,000 fires on this one. So 30 definitely is not enough. You want 1,000. Then when you&#039;ve got a thousand, you select this, then you click on actions, create lookalike, and then you want to start off with a 1% and then you want to select your location and then you want to create your audience. Then it will take a while to populate, but Facebook will create a lookalike audience based off the data that it&#039;s accumulated on your specific conversion pixel and this is what we call a lookalike. It&#039;s basically a genetically-engineering audience that has close affinity to the people that have converted. This is a very, very powerful method.

However, you can only use it if you have 1,000 conversion and that takes a while. You want to use methods number one first, then method number two, then when you&#039;ve exhausted one and two, you want to move into method three. Once you&#039;ve got that thousand fires, boom, you&#039;re into method four. Once you&#039;re able to use method one, two, three, and four, well, you&#039;re rich. You&#039;re making a lot of money by this stage. And if you&#039;re not, then something fundamentally is wrong with your offer and your proof of concept because you shouldn&#039;t even need to have this level of knowledge about Facebook if you have a good proof of concept. Truthfully, you can get by by hardly knowing anything about Facebook ads if you have a good proof of concept. If you know a lot of stuff, you&#039;re using it and you aren&#039;t rich, then your proof of concept&#039;s probably pretty shit.

Now we&#039;re going to talk about Archimedes lever, so financial engineering to displace the earth. You&#039;re probably thinking well, with all of these methods for scaling, how could we possibly need anything else? What else could we need? We&#039;ve already got enough to really scale into the high seven figures. Well, as any Facebook advertiser or business owner or no, to scale big, you need money. What you want to do is think of Facebook ads and funnels as a machine and money is the fuel that drives the machine. You might be thinking, &quot;Well, don&#039;t our ads make us money? If we spend money on ads and they work, shouldn&#039;t we make money? We shouldn&#039;t have any money issues because we&#039;ve got money from the ads that we can spend back into the ads, right?&quot;

&quot;Well, how can we need money if our ads make us money?&quot; This is what most people think. That, my friend, is the smartest question anybody has ever asked, even though nobody has ever asked it, but they should. If you&#039;re spending money on your ads, this is the start of our fragmentation funnel. We pay money to Facebook and then Facebook shows our ads to our audience. Then people see our ads, then they click on them, then they come to the landing page, then they opt in, then they come to the value video, then they watch it and then they decide to complete the survey. Then after that, we approve them or we reject them and then they show up to add appointment and we have a call with and we take them through our [inaudible 00:49:07] conversion script.

Then after that, they either become a customer or they don&#039;t. If they do become a customer, they pay us and we receive money. We have money spent on ads in the first instance, so money&#039;s going out. But then we have money coming in, money received from sales. If your campaign and your ads and everything is set up correctly, then you should be putting in less than you&#039;re getting out and that is the very premise of profit and that&#039;s how you make your return on investment. More money out, then money is put in. Outputs are greater than inputs. So if we put in one unit, then we should get out two units. If we put in a hundred bucks, we make two hundred. We put in a thousand, we make two thousand. That&#039;s how it works.

If there&#039;s an ROI and we&#039;re making more than we spend, how come we need to have money? We&#039;re making money. How come we need money to scale? I mean, we can just put this money back in. Well, what you&#039;re about to see is one of the most devastatingly powerful methods of scale a person can possibly learn and this is way beyond the intelligence of most marketers and it&#039;s my secret weapon. So what is it? Well, it&#039;s a method of financial engineering and I call it Archimedes lever and it&#039;s financial engineering to displace the earth.

First off, let&#039;s debunk then biggest lie in the marketing world right now and this is it. I hear this quote all the time. &quot;It&#039;s all about lifetime value. It&#039;s all about that LTV.&quot; A lot of people think that it&#039;s all about how much money you&#039;re going to collect from a customer over their lifetime. You can spend any amount of money trying to acquire them provided it&#039;s less than their lifetime value. If a customer&#039;s going to spend 10 grand with us, we can spend five grand to acquire them. That&#039;s not true and I&#039;m going to show you why right now. A lot of people hop on about LTV and it really is just a big lie and a big myth. Let me demonstrate for you.

Let&#039;s say I spend $500 on ads for 25 days. That&#039;s a total spend of 12 and a half thousand dollars. Then let&#039;s say I receive $30,000 from that advertising, that&#039;s a hundred and forty percent return on investment. That&#039;s pretty decent. Here&#039;s how we can get ourselves into trouble. I modeled this out, this is a scenario. Now this is made up so these numbers, they look way too ... It&#039;s random as I can try to make them. They don&#039;t look real because these are fake numbers but I&#039;m just trying to demonstrate this here.

If we spend $500 [inaudible 00:52:03] ads, we get all of these clicks, CPCs, leads, and everything and we&#039;re getting different calls and we&#039;re getting a decent cost per strategy session. But what can happen is let&#039;s say we&#039;re not making sales in the beginning and then we get a huge amount of sales towards the end of the month. Well, what will happen is if we&#039;re not making sales here, as you can see, we&#039;re starting to go backwards into the red and we go to a peak of minus eight and a half thousand dollars before we make a whole bunch of sales and when we start getting into the green again. And then at the end of it, we make a profit of 17 and a half thousand dollars. Our total spend is 12 and a half grand, our total made is 30 grand, and our total profit is 17 and a half grand and that means our ROI is a hundred and forty percent, right?

So even though we&#039;ve got a good ROI, even though we&#039;re making a lot of money, at some point, we went backwards by eight and a half grand. This is what most people don&#039;t understand. On a chart, it can make it a little bit easier to understand. Here&#039;s spending $500 a day each day over time and as you can see, we start to go down. We go below zero. We go eight and a half grand down. But then we start to go up and then we start to make money and at the end, we end up 17 and a half grand up in clear profit. We end up making 17 and a half grand in profit but we lose a total of eight and a half grand before we make a single dollar. This is what we call a trough because it&#039;s like a hole, it&#039;s like a trough.

Marketers hops on about LTV being the key metric. They&#039;re like, &quot;You can spend tons of money on ads and everything because you know that these leads are going to buy from you eventually,&quot; and this is why we see people running lead-generation campaigns. These campaigns are absolutely pointless. You just don&#039;t want to collect leads because how do you know those leads are going to buy from you? You don&#039;t. You have no idea. And so really, what you want to be doing is only ever running advertising campaigns that have some sort of sales mechanism in them because that way, you can measure that you&#039;re getting leads and at the same time getting sales, and you&#039;re not just getting leads and hoping that they&#039;re going to turn into sales later. This is where this LTV metric causes a lot of damage and it&#039;s done a lot of damage to a lot of people in this industry and other industries.

The truth is is you can&#039;t get to the LTV which might be 17 and a half grand. You can&#039;t go to here up here. You can&#039;t go to this nice profitable point without going through here first. You must go through the downside here to get to the upside and this is what most marketers don&#039;t understand. They think because they&#039;re making profit and the number say that they&#039;re making ROI that it&#039;s all good. But all of them find themselves trapped in this hole because they start scaling up, they start scaling up, then they&#039;re stuck and they can&#039;t get to the hotspot because they can&#039;t weather the storm and get through this trough. Like I showed you in our example, we went eight and a half grand into the red before we went 17 and a half grand up into profit and really, that&#039;s nothing, like $500 a day, that&#039;s not much scale.

I know to a lot of you watching this, your $500 probably is a lot of money per day. But let&#039;s say we scale that 10X. So if we&#039;re spending $500 a day, now we&#039;re going to be spending $5,000 a day. Some of my students are up at this. I know Andrew Argue is spending five grand or more on Facebook ads per day and he&#039;s making around 900 grand per month right now, so he&#039;s pretty much on the eight figures. Just waiting for him to clock a few months at 900 grand a month before I officially announce it as an eight-figure student, but he&#039;s legitimately spending five grand a day on ads.

Well, here&#039;s what you need to be aware of when you&#039;re spending five grand a day on ads. If you go through a trough, you might not go through this but you also could go through this. If you&#039;re spending five grand a day on ads and you have a strangely displaced ... If you have a strangely skewed distribution of sales, let&#039;s say you go for a period where you&#039;re not making any sales for some reason but then you make a whole bunch and the average of the total time range is pretty good but at one particular point in time, it wasn&#039;t very good. This happens all the time with numbers. This is how numbers work. Well, if you&#039;re spending five grand a day, you could go $65,000 down before you go $195,000 up. So you know, a hundred ninety-five grand profit is huge but going 65 grand backwards is huge, too and most people, they can&#039;t survive the 65 grand so they can&#039;t get to the hundred ninety-five grand.

This is what happens to all marketers, every single one I&#039;ve ever seen. They start scaling and they think that they&#039;re going to be able to be kings and scale big time, and then they freak out because they start having some days where the sales aren&#039;t coming and they just can&#039;t afford to keep forking out five grand a day, so they freak out and they bail out and they&#039;re out of the game. This is why it&#039;s important to understand this. And really, even five grand a day, that&#039;s nothing. I&#039;ve scaled my ads up to 30 grand a day and this is where I&#039;ve scaled, too. And honestly, when we go to launch our Facebook firestorm or the marketing firestorm, I&#039;m going to spend up to about a hundred grand a day.

Let&#039;s just have a look at what would happen at 30 grand a day if we started to have a little trough. This is the same model but with 30 grand a day in ad spend. We could make 1.05 million. This is up here. However, if things went bad, we could go $390,000 down. Now not everyone just has the ability to do that even if they were able to make that or they don&#039;t have the courage and the patience and the intelligence to know what&#039;s going on when this trough happens. You can&#039;t get to here without going through here first. This is just a simple fact and this is why this is so important to understand when you&#039;re going to scale big.

An LTV is meaningless unless you can weather the storm and make it through the trough. Simply put, at scale, conversions can regress longer than marketers can stay solvent. What this means is we talked about regression to the mean when we&#039;re talking about salesman killers and that these are things that salespeople always fall for. It&#039;s like they can be making five or six sales in one day and then they have 10 or 11 days where they don&#039;t make a single sale and they start freaking out and they think something&#039;s wrong but really, it&#039;s just regression to the mean.

Well, what happens is when you&#039;re scaling your ads that big, the regression to the mean can swing longer than most marketers can stay solvent. If you do experience regression to the mean and you&#039;re spending a lot of money per day, well you might not get that swing to come back your way until you&#039;ve run out of money, and this is what happens to a lot of marketers. The thing kicks, the pendulum kicks out to one side, and that&#039;s normal and they&#039;re still paying your ad spend but then the pendulum doesn&#039;t swing back onto this side and turn into profit and they&#039;ve run out of money, and so they have to just bail out.

What&#039;s so important with scale is that you can hold, you can have enough money and enough liquidity to keep paying while this pendulum swings out and then it swings back on your side, and then you always end up making a lot of money. This is how it happens. What can we do about it? Now that you&#039;re aware of it and conscious of how this thing exists, what can you actually do about it? Well, now it&#039;s time to show you my secret weapon, cashflow engineering. Here is cashflow engineering explained.

Here&#039;s where we put the money in and here&#039;s where we get the money out. Well, cashflow engineering is when this ... We use this money that comes out and we feed it back in here. We keep feeding this money around in a loop here. What we do is we want to work really hard to reduce the cashflow cycles to less than 30 days and that means when we put a dollar in, we want to make sure that the dollar is coming out within 30 days. So dollar in, dollar comes out within 30 days and we&#039;re trying to get at least two to one ROI. So we put a dollar in, 30 days goes by, we get two out. Ideally, it should be a shorter timeframe. Dollars in, two dollars out. Dollars in, two dollars out and less than 30 days timeframe here. Here, I explained cashflow engineering.

So you want to reduce the cashflow cycles to less than 30 days and then use a credit card to float the ad spend. This way, your cash reserves remain untouched and all spend goes on credit but is paid back by day 30 at a 0% interest rate but with an ROI interest rate of 200% plus. Let me explain this. This is really a huge secret. If you&#039;ve got a funnel and it&#039;s proven and you just know this process is proven and you know it&#039;s proven because you&#039;ve done it and you&#039;re absolutely confident and that you&#039;ve been tracking your numbers, you just know it. Well, then you can track well how long does it take for me to spend the money and get it back. We can calculate these cashflow cycles.

If your cashflow cycle is less than 30 days, that means you can put a credit card into Facebook. Now instead of it using your cash out of your bank account, it&#039;s using credit on a credit card so it&#039;s not touching your cash, so you can still hold your cash for living on and emergencies and all that stuff. But what&#039;s feeding your ad spend is credit which is just paper but we have to pay for it when it hits the end of its credit card cycle. We use it and then the credit card cycle comes up in say 30 days.

If we pay the credit card bill on time on its cycle, it&#039;s 0% interest and we get the points too which is a bonus. So we don&#039;t pay any interest to the bank for using the credit card. It&#039;s free money provided we pay it within the 30 days. We want to make sure that our cashflow cycle really is within 30 days. We don&#039;t want to be stupid here. If it&#039;s outside 30 days, well we&#039;re now we&#039;re going to pay interest. If it&#039;s not paying back at all, well now we&#039;re just going to get ourselves into a lot of trouble. You really got to be honest with yourself. Don&#039;t go and start leveraging this thing up until you absolutely know that the money&#039;s going to come back. Otherwise, you&#039;ll just get yourself into a big mess.

When you&#039;re sure of it and your cashflow cycle is all within 30 days, then you put the money on a card, credit card. And then you get the bill for the credit card and you&#039;ve got the money for it because you ROI&#039;d within the 30 days, so you pay your card. You didn&#039;t have to pay them any interest but from your ROI, you made 200% interest. Typically, people use their credit cards to buy stupid things like TVs, beer, and other stuff and when they do that, they don&#039;t get any money back, obviously. And so they&#039;re using credit to buy something that makes no money. When they do that, the thing that they buy obviously makes them no money and they have to end up paying their credit card bill and then often, they don&#039;t pay it on time so now they&#039;re paying interest on their credit card bill.

This is an absolute reverse way to use a credit card. It&#039;s where we use the money and we use it for an activity that makes money. Then we get our money out and then we pay the bill, 0% interest, and then we get our ROI which is 200%. So we&#039;re gaming the system. We&#039;re making 200% ROI on money that isn&#039;t even ours. That is the ultimate cashflow engineering. How to use the money that isn&#039;t yours to make a 200% ROI. This is how it&#039;s done, and it is extremely powerful.

How to use cashflow engineering to scale? The first step is to test your ads and funnel over and over again, iterating and improving everything until the KPIs are well within the student benchmark range and ROI is at least two to one or three to one. This absolutely must be done first, non-negotiable, must be done first. The next step is to determine your cashflow cycle period, and this is the average amount of time it takes to liquidate your ad spend from the day it&#039;s spent. For example, if you spent $300 today on ad spend, how long till that $300 comes back? Calculate it. What is your cashflow cycle? Is it 40 days, 30 days, 60 days, 50 days, 10 days? What is it?

And you want to be extremely confident in your numbers and KPIs and keep iterating and improving until you have a cashflow cycle that&#039;s less than 30 days. And the shorter, the better because the shorter we&#039;re able to liquidate our money, the better because we&#039;re going to have way better awareness and we&#039;re going to be able to always have the cash on hand so we&#039;re never really risking much. When you have a cashflow cycle within 30 days and you have confidence in your numbers and KPIs, it&#039;s time to start using a credit card to fund the ad spend. The reason why we use a credit card is because this isn&#039;t our cash and it&#039;s basically free money to float this thing with, provided we pay it back before it starts growing interest.

And so we don&#039;t want to just dive in and just start cranking this thing up crazy. We want to start increasing it slowly and measuring ROI and cycles to make sure that it&#039;s still lining up. Let&#039;s say we&#039;re spending $300 a day and then we start putting it on our card, then we could start cranking up to four, five, six, seven hundred dollars a day. And as we crank up, we want to make sure that we&#039;re still making ROI and our cashflow cycles are still within 30 days.

This is really a shift in mindset. Playing like this requires a mindset shift. We&#039;re no longer looking at how much money we can lose before we&#039;re out. Most people I find, when they look at Facebook ads, they look at how much money is in their bank account and then they think, &quot;Okay, well I can only really spend this much money because this is all the money I&#039;ve got and if I spend more money than that, then I&#039;m out.&quot; Well, if you think about that technically, that&#039;s playing to lose.

And so we&#039;re no longer looking at how much we can lose before we&#039;re out. We&#039;re looking at how much money we will win from the money rest and making sure it happens in time. And it&#039;s a shift from playing to lose to playing to win. Instead of looking at how much money we can possibly lose and then really playing on that, I mean we&#039;ve tested our funnel. We know it works and now instead of playing with a mind of like, &quot;Well, how much can we lose,&quot; we&#039;re looking at, &quot;We&#039;re playing to win.&quot; There&#039;s a big difference. One is looking at the worst case, the other one is really looking at the proven numbers and trusting it.

Now in the initial stages when we&#039;re testing and everything and we&#039;re establishing ourselves, we really need to have a play to lose mindset because if things go wrong, we don&#039;t want to get burned. However, once we really have confidence in our numbers and everything&#039;s tested and proven, we need to shift our mindset from playing to lose to playing to win. This is a big shift. We&#039;re now starting to really get a lot ballsier with things and we&#039;re starting to utilize leverage and credit card cycles and things like this so that we can put up big money. To put up big money, you need absolute faith in your KPIs. If you don&#039;t trust your funnel, if you don&#039;t trust your sales script, if you don&#039;t trust your ads or your campaigns or your KPIs or anything, then you&#039;re never going to have the balls required to do this. You have to have huge trust in all of this stuff in order to do it. But if you do it properly, if you follow this process, then you will have it.

I have absolute faith in my KPIs. I bet millions on them all the time and it always comes back to me and I don&#039;t lose a single minute of sleep about it. You know, I put millions of dollars into things and I&#039;m just chilled out because I know these numbers are true and I know it&#039;s coming back. It&#039;s fact because I&#039;ve seen it happen so many times and I just know these things. It&#039;s like a sixth sense. When your numbers line up and you&#039;ve been in the game for a while, you start to develop a sixth sense for this stuff and it&#039;s like time slows down. The numbers start talking to you. You can see the matrix and you know where to press to make something pop out and appear. When you learn to see these things and can feel them in your bones, you can&#039;t be afraid to bet big.

This is a pinup available for download beneath this video on the resources section and it says learning to see the matrix. With sales course, funnels, and Facebook ads, there comes a time when you&#039;ve been doing it for long enough, it&#039;s like you&#039;ve developed a sixth sense and it&#039;s like time slows down and the numbers start speaking to you. You can see the matrix and you know where to press to make something pop out and appear. When you learn to see these things and can feel them in your bones, you can&#039;t be afraid to come on strong and bet big, real big. What I mean by this is once you&#039;ve been doing it for a while and it takes practice, this isn&#039;t something that you go out and read about. You go through this program and this program teaches you exactly what to do. I haven&#039;t seen anything else like this for Facebook ads. This is next level stuff. If you truly understand all of this and you apply it, then you&#039;re going to get exceptionally good at it.

Then as you start to look at your numbers more often, as you&#039;re reporting on your KPIs, as you start testing things, you change this and then you change that and you see what happens and you start to observe, &quot;Well, what happens if I change this,&quot; and then you observe, &quot;Aha, that happens. &quot;Then you change this, then you see something else happen. You start to really see how things all interconnect and you start to really learn what&#039;s going on. It&#039;s really hard to describe but it&#039;s like you can just ... The numbers start talking to you. You can start looking at your ads account. You can start looking at all of your different KPIs and you know what to do.

There really isn&#039;t any other way to describe it. It isn&#039;t a logical skill that you can really pick up. It just comes from practice and it&#039;s what I call really learning to see the matrix because when this happens to you, when you can start to see these things, you will just know about it. You&#039;ll see it and you&#039;ll know that this is one of these things that you need to put money on to or bet big on or you know this one thing is something that you need to crank the scale right up on.

When you start to see these things, when the numbers start speaking to you and you really feel like you can see the matrix with Facebook ads, you need to learn to bet big. You just can&#039;t whimper off when you see these opportunities because when these opportunities present themselves, the opportunity is only open for so long. When you see it, you need to absolutely go big. And that&#039;s why on a lot of things, I&#039;ll pour a ton of money on to them real quick. When I see a proven adset, it&#039;s going from 300, $400,000 a day in ad spend to $30,000 a day in like 10 days. That&#039;s how quick I&#039;ll pile it up and ratchet it up because when I see something and I know it&#039;s it, then I&#039;m going to go big.

That&#039;s how you have to train yourself, too. You have to learn when to see these things, how to see them and everything and you need to go big when you see them. Don&#039;t just whimper off and don&#039;t just play small when these things appear because it&#039;s not just seeing them, it&#039;s learning to act when you see them as well. And I can&#039;t wait till people in this program start to be able to see it. It will completely change the game for you.

I helped Andrew Argue really get there with his business and he can really see it now. Like I said, he&#039;s spending around five grand a day on ads and his business the last few months has made just over $900,000 a month, so he&#039;s pretty much at eight figures. I&#039;m just waiting for him to get one or two more months there, then we&#039;re going to ... I&#039;m going to announce that one. But this is what truly can happen when you start to see the matrix. Andrew went from 17 grand January last year to now more than $900,000 a month. This really is the ultimate level of scale. It&#039;s when you can just look at it and know what to do. It&#039;s like thinking doesn&#039;t even happen. It&#039;s just a natural sense and reaction. This is when the big scale happens. It&#039;s something that you can&#039;t even really teach. It&#039;s just something that comes from practice.

So that&#039;s it for Facebook training in week five. I hope you&#039;ve enjoyed it. It took me a huge amount of time to make and we&#039;ve covered everything from the absolute bare basics where we introduced you to what Facebook was all the way through to the highest level of scale and understanding that I am aware of when it comes to Facebook ads. So congratulations on making it all the way through. I hope you&#039;ve enjoyed it and I will see you in the next week&#039;s section which is week six. Thanks for watching and I&#039;ll see you in week six.
