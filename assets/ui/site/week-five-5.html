                        Hey everyone, Sam Ovens here and welcome to this training module called Your Ad Hypothesis. So in this module I&#039;m going to show you how to create your ads, and we need to do this correctly because we need to have a variation of ads. We don&#039;t just randomly come up with one ad and then just put it out in front of an audience. I mean that&#039;s what you do if you don&#039;t want to really have any success and if you don&#039;t really know what you&#039;re doing. There is a particular way that we create our ads and there is particular clues where we can get information from so that we can create ads that have a high chance of working right away.


And there&#039;s a special structure and architecture, which we need to use to make sure that we can load Facebook&#039;s algorithm with enough variation so that it can go out and do its thing, and find the right combinations of variables, so that we have profitable ads and we produce those blue swan ad sets that we&#039;re trying to achieve. So this is a very powerful video because I&#039;m going to introduce you to a lot of swipe files, I&#039;m going to introduce you to a lot of ads I&#039;ve run. I&#039;m going to show you five different ads I&#039;ve run that have all made more than $1 million each. So I&#039;m going to introduce you to some actual real life million-dollar ads, five of them, and I&#039;m going to give you lots of resources that you can use to create really good ads yourself. So this is one of the most important videos and modules in the entire Facebook advertising trainings, so make sure that you pay close attention.


So let&#039;s get started. So here&#039;s what going to be covering in today&#039;s module. We&#039;re going to start off by analyzing your proof of concept, and we&#039;re going to be recalling what has and hasn&#039;t worked in the lab, and by the lab I mean your testing. When you are out and you&#039;re getting clients and you were doing strategy sessions, recording your calls, recording the feedback, all of that stuff, well you gonna have learned a lot of things. You gonna have learned what has and hasn&#039;t worked and that information is going to be crucial when it comes to creating your ads. Then we&#039;re going to look at extracting fractal patterns, and this is hypothesizing the ideal stimuli for blue swans. So within your proof of concept, there will be clues as to what&#039;s going to work on the Facebook platform.


Just like with fractals, a fractal ad tells a story about the process that created it, and what&#039;s that? The fractal pattern present in your proof of concept, it won&#039;t look the same in the proof of concept as it will on the Facebook platform, but it will give us essential clues that we need so that we can have a high chance of getting successful ads right away. Then we&#039;re going to cover Facebook&#039;s Golden Mean, which is the architecture of a perfect campaign. So this is the perfect structure of a campaign. How many ads? How many audiences? How many images? So I&#039;m going to show you really that perfect balance, which is what I call Facebook&#039;s Golden Mean. Then we&#039;re going to cover how to hypnotize a swan, and this is the basics of copywriting and direct response, so I&#039;m going to introduce you to these tools and tell you why they are of extreme importance when it comes to writing good ads.


If you don&#039;t know what direct response and copywriting is, and you try and create ads, well there&#039;s a high chance that they&#039;re not going to work. So I&#039;m going to introduce you to the basics of that and give you some swipe files and everything. Then we&#039;re actually going to go ahead and craft your ads, so we&#039;re going to that in this module. We&#039;re going to type up your ads, we&#039;re going to come up with the headlines, the copy, the images, all of that. So it&#039;s a action-packed video; let&#039;s get to it. So at this stage of the Facebook ads training you should have a strong understanding of the platform, the algorithm and its rules, and you should have your website compliant, your ads account and fan page set up correctly, and your fragmentation funnel tested and ready to go. Now it&#039;s time to start building your campaign. So let&#039;s get to work.


So the first step is to analyze your proof of concept and recall what has and hasn&#039;t worked in the lab. So, do you remember our scientific method that we&#039;ve referenced constantly throughout this training pretty much in every single module and every single week? Well, when it comes to Facebook ads, we&#039;re constantly optimizing for the perfect combination of variables in the current environment, and this combination of variables we refer to as DNA, and that DNA string is made up of these three variables; audience, message and image. And we&#039;re looking for the right combination of those that&#039;s going to generate good results for us. What we do, is we use Facebook&#039;s algorithm, which is an optimization machine and it keys through all of these different variables and it tries to find the perfect combination.


So it&#039;s really just going through this process here, where it starts with audience and then it combines an audience with a message and an image and then it&#039;s trying to get a result, which is a click or a website opt-in or something like that, and then the algorithm receives feedback and then it start optimizing. It starts really clamping down on what&#039;s working and it starts ignoring what doesn&#039;t work. It&#039;s an extremely powerful optimization machine, and when you work with it correctly and when you load it with enough variation, you will get some amazing results and be able to make a lot of money with it. Just with, like with our brain and the way we work, when we are about to do something we have a hypothesis function, and what that means is that when we want to achieve something we kind of think out into the future, and we think about the result that we want to achieve or the goal that we want to achieve and that&#039;s really our results hypothesis.


It&#039;s a thought into the future and then we set a goalpost there or a milestone. Then we come back to the present moment and we start thinking, &quot;Well, if we want to achieve this result, then what action do we need to take? What do we believe is the best action to take in order to achieve this result?&quot; That&#039;s what we start thinking. Once we&#039;ve come up with a clear result hypothesis and then we&#039;ve come up with an action hypothesis about what we should do right now and what action we believe has the highest chances of achieving the result, then we actually take action and we actually do it. Then we will have the outcome and then the outcome will provide us with feedback. We either will hit our goal or we won&#039;t, and we&#039;ll get feedback and we&#039;ll be able to do it again and iterate each time, and eventually we will be able to achieve our goal.


That&#039;s how the optimization process works. Well, with Facebook, it works pretty much exactly the same. It&#039;s going out into the future and it&#039;s really thinking of a result hypothesis, which is it&#039;s trying to get clicks. We have a limit of how much money we can really pay per click and still will remain profitable, and I shared those numbers with you in the previous module. What Facebook&#039;s doing is it&#039;s trying to optimize the right combination of audience and message and image to achieve that result at that price, and it&#039;s really just optimizing like crazy trying to find that, and that&#039;s what it&#039;s doing. To be clear, here is our workflow, and here&#039;s our scientific method to really working with Facebook and finding out what works and what doesn&#039;t. So the scientific method workflow; we covered this on the previous module but I&#039;m just going to cover it very quickly again here just to refresh you on it because it&#039;s important to understand as we go in to create our ads.


So before we touch Facebook, we need to form a hypothesis for both the results we expect and the combination of audience, message required to achieve those results. In order to form a hypothesis, we must have an established proof of concept. Without a proof of concept you may as well burn your money. I&#039;ve made that clear. So when we&#039;re forming a results hypothesis, we&#039;ve already covered that in the last module. I&#039;ve provided you with the benchmarks and the numbers and all of that stuff so you know what to expect when it comes to the result. Now we&#039;re going to talk about step three, which is forming your audience message hypothesis. So we must hypothesize about the combination of audience message variables we believe will work together to achieve the results hypothesis. The only way to do this is if we have an established proof of concept, and the proof of concept will give us all the essential clues we need.


Then once we get the essential clues out of there, then we&#039;re able to form our hypothesis and then we&#039;re able to take it to the market for testing, submit it to the Facebook platform, and then the algorithm will start keying through all the different combinations of variables trying to find ones that work and ones that don&#039;t. Then the algorithms are going to be iterating and hopefully, with really the first time, we should be able to find things that work and we won&#039;t need to create new stuff. However, if the algorithm doesn&#039;t find things that work, then we will have to iterate ourselves, but it&#039;s a process where both you and the algorithm are performing iterations, and both you and the algorithm are performing the scientific method. What we&#039;re really going to be covering in this module today, is forming this audience message hypothesis.


So really how to get this dialed in. So right now our task is to form your ad hypothesis, and the first step in doing this is to recall what has and hasn&#039;t worked in the lab. What I mean by this is really thinking ... When I say the lab, I mean back to when you were initially doing strategy sessions and all of that stuff. At this point, you should have a proof of concept, which means you&#039;ve got three paying clients, and if have those, if you have three paying clients, then you&#039;ve probably done quite a lot of strategy sessions. I&#039;m assuming more than 20. And if you&#039;ve done more than 20 strategy sessions and you actually have three paying clients, well you should have a lot of information.


Not only in your head from doing them, but a lot of information on the recordings of those strategy sessions, and on the worksheets you&#039;ve completed so far, and in the feedback that you would&#039;ve noted down as you&#039;ve done all of these different calls. There&#039;s going to be a wealth of knowledge in all of that, and that&#039;s going to really give us the essential information that we need to know, so that we can form our ads. Before we touch the Facebook platform, we need to form our ad hypothesis. This is really important. We don&#039;t just jump into Facebook and start typing ads up and just putting random images in there. That&#039;s what people do and it doesn&#039;t work for them. We need to have a more scientific approach than that, because that just straight up doesn&#039;t work.


95% of the results you achieve on Facebook will actually be work that you do off of Facebook. Working on the Facebook platform is the easiest part, it&#039;s just clicking some buttons. It&#039;s the work you do off the platform that really matters. We want to think about what messages, angles and images etc. will resonate with our niche and get them to take action by clicking on our ad. So you really want to think about, think back to when you were doing all of your strategy sessions and everything, and start to think about all of the different things that you&#039;ve seen and that you heard. You really want to start thinking what would be some good messages and some good angles that would really get the attention of your niche, and get them to click on your ad.


You just want to start thinking about it at this moment, and like I&#039;ve said a million times, this can only be done when you have an established proof of concept. If you don&#039;t have one of those, well you don&#039;t know what to think about. We want to analyze your proof of concept and look at what has and hasn&#039;t worked. Within your proof of concept you&#039;ll have a successful combination of niche, offer, result variables. This is going to give us the essential clues that we need. So step four. To do this you want to refer back to these items. At this stage of the program you should have all of these items, and this is going to be a gold mine of information. With this stuff, the ads are pretty much going to write themselves. This is why I&#039;ve got you to do all of this work up until this point.


This is why I said back in week one that setting the foundations was so important. If you&#039;re one of the people that set the foundations correctly in week one, well you&#039;re going to absolutely fly with Facebook ads. However, if you&#039;re someone that didn&#039;t, well it probably isn&#039;t going to work for you at all. You need to have your niche, offer, result, hypothesis worksheet handy. That&#039;s a worksheet back from week one. You should&#039;ve completed it, you should have it in our action items system back from week one. So you want to go back and fetch that now. You also want to get your message hypothesis worksheet, and then you want to get your feedback from all the sales calls and recordings of the sales calls. So when you were doing the sales calls, you should&#039;ve been taking down feedback and writing it on the different worksheets.


So you want to go back and fetch that, and all of your sales calls recordings, so you should&#039;ve recorded all of your sales calls. Now you want to go back and get them too. The information within those items will contain everything you need to form your ad hypothesis. So what we&#039;re basically going to do, you need to have all of that information handy and next to you, and then as we&#039;re creating your ad, we&#039;re going to refer to that information to really extract different things so that we know what to put in the ads. It&#039;s going to be really easy if you&#039;ve got the stuff next to you. It&#039;s going to be impossible if you don&#039;t. For the rest of this week&#039;s training, make sure you have all of those items handy so that we can refer back to them, and we&#039;re going to need them for almost everything we do when it comes to Facebook ads.


Once you have these items handy, it&#039;s time to form the actual ad hypothesis. So if you&#039;ve got those items ready, awesome. Let&#039;s start forming this ad hypothesis now. If you don&#039;t, then pause this video, go sort all of those things out. Go pull them up, go find them and familiarize yourself with them. So if you&#039;ve got that done, let&#039;s do it. So the next step is extracting fractal patterns, and this is hypothesizing the ideal stimuli for blue swans. So this is really extracting the patterns from our proof of concept, so that we can use it within the Facebook platform, so that we can generate those blue swan ad sets, which are profitable ad sets. So, do you remember what fractals are? We covered it in module one of this week&#039;s training, which is called Fractal Facebook Evolution.


Well fractals are self-similar never-ending patterns. A fractal is a never-ending pattern and they&#039;re infinitely complex but they&#039;re self-similar across different scales. They&#039;re created by repeating a simple process over and over in an ongoing feedback loop. Natural fractals include branching patterns like trees, river networks, lightning bolts, blood vessels and spiral patterns like seashells, hurricanes, galaxies, and then there&#039;s man-made fractals that include things like the Internet, telephone, social networks, radio, TV, all of that stuff. Well, it&#039;s really important to understand fractals because that is how the Facebook platform works and it&#039;s how Facebook ads work. There are fractal patterns in our proof of concept, and I covered this as well but I&#039;m just going to quickly go back over it again so that it&#039;s fresh in your mind.


So when you establish your proof of concept by proving your niche, offer, result, hypothesis in the world by getting at least three paying clients, the behavior and dynamics and math you observe during your testing stages, will be representative of the behavior dynamics and math you observe when scaled up industry-wide. You want to think of the small niche test groups as the microcosm and the entire industry as the macrocosm. Whatever traits you observed during testing will be similar, only magnified when scaled. So plain and simple, to really take that fractal stuff and just summarize it with one sentence, a fractal tells a story about the process that created it. So if we can observe a fractal then we can really see what sort of process created it.


It&#039;s really important because when we have a proof of concept, that means we can look at it and observe what process created it, what process brought about the success that you have at a small scale. Because that process that brought about the success you have at a small scale, is going to be the same process that&#039;s going to bring about the success that you achieve at a large scale on the Facebook platform. You need to be really good at seeing these things, because when you can see them it will change your life. You will be able to make a serious amount of money. Let&#039;s extract the fractal patterns from your proof of concept right now. To do this, I have provided you with a worksheet, which is available for download beneath this video, and it&#039;s called Extracting Fractal Patterns.


This worksheet helps us extract the essential information from your proof of concept so that we can use it to create some dangerously powerful ads, and I mean it. When we do this thing properly, your ads are going to scream. So let&#039;s take a look at it. So I&#039;m going to pull this up here. It&#039;s available for download as a PDF beneath this video, and you can download it and then you can click this link here and you can open it in Google Drive as well. I suggest using it in Google Drive. Like with everything, it&#039;s better to have an online copy than a copy on your computer, and you can also edit the copy in Google Drive; you can&#039;t edit this PDF. What you want to do is you want to go through these questions and you want to answer them, because at this stage if we&#039;re going to get you onto the Facebook platform we&#039;re going to start scaling you up.


Well, you should have a proof of concept, and if you&#039;ve got a proof of concept well these questions are going to extract the important information that we need. It&#039;s really going to extract that fractal pattern that&#039;s really working. So question one, how would you describe your niche? Who are they? What demographic are they in? And what do they call themselves? And what would others call them? This is important because we need to know just in a sentence or two ... How would we describe it? And what is the current situation? By that I mean what&#039;s the situation before they meet you? What&#039;s the situation that they&#039;re at now and ... There&#039;s always the gap. There&#039;s the situation they have now, then there&#039;s the situation they want in the future. Well what is the situation they have now? Define it. Define it as clearly as you can.


And why is the current situation painful? If they&#039;re coming to you, they obviously want to change their current situation. So if they want to change it, then it&#039;s obviously not something that they want, so I&#039;m assuming that there&#039;s some pain there or something. Why is their current situation painful? Really write that down. Take some time to think about this stuff. Seriously, take some time to complete this worksheet because the information we extract here is going to be an absolute gold mine for your ads. This stuff here that we find here, it writes the ads itself and the ads will work like crazy, so take your time to do this. How would they describe their current situation? You described it, but now how would they describe it?


We want to know what their words are, and you should know this because you did strategy sessions with them and you asked them about their current situation, and you should&#039;ve recorded your strategy sessions, so this is a no-brainer. We just have to go back and listen to those parts of the strategy session calls. How would they describe their pain? You described it, but now how did they describe it? You can go back and listen to the calls. What were their words? How did they describe not liking where they are? And how would others describe their current situation and pain? Now it&#039;s important to get a couple of different perspectives here because quite often there&#039;s different ways that we can really look at it. There&#039;s from the actual participant&#039;s view, which is the person who is in pain.


We want to know how they would describe their situation and how they would describe the pain, then you, how you would describe it, and then how would some outsider describe it. It&#039;s important to get these different perspectives, and what is their desired situation. Now that we&#039;ve covered their current situation, what is the desired situation? What do they want to achieve? Write it down, make it clear. Why is their desired situation better than their current situation? Why is this desired situation any better at all? Why is it desirable? Write it down. How would they describe their desired situation? So in their words, how would they describe it? Now, again, this is really easy because you&#039;ve done the strategy sessions, you&#039;ve recorded the strategy sessions, and you asked this question to everybody who you did a strategy session with, so you have this information, it&#039;s in your recordings.


Go back, extract it, listen to them, skip to this part of the call, write it down. How would they describe the pleasure of being at their desired situation? So what words did they use on the calls, if you&#039;ve got them? If you&#039;ve had conversations with them, what were their words? How did they describe it? Now, how would others describe it? We want to get these different perspectives. How do you describe it? How do they describe it? How would an outsider describe it.? And what&#039;s blocking them from achieving their desired situation on their own? Now this is huge &#039;cause we need to get this understanding here. What&#039;s their desired situation? What&#039;s their current situation? What&#039;s the gap in between? Why do they want it? And why can&#039;t they get there on their own? &#039;Cause if they could get there on their own, they would&#039;ve done it, and they wouldn&#039;t have had a call with you.


So what&#039;s blocking them? And again, this one&#039;s easy because in the strategy session script, you would&#039;ve asked this question. We asked this exact question, you have the recordings, so go listen to them and write down the information that they used here. And then how would they describe the thing that&#039;s blocking them? In question six, we described it in our language and as clearly as we can define it, but then in question seven, we define it using their words and we get that from our strategy session calls. And then how would they describe the pain and frustration this block causes? Again, this is going to come from the strategy session calls. We will be able to listen to their language, we will be able to listen to how they say this, because we asked them, &quot;What&#039;s stopping you from achieving this on your own?&quot;


Well, go and listen to what they say. This is where all the gold comes from. With Facebook ads, like I said before, 95% of the results you get from Facebook ads will come from work you do off of Facebook ads. That&#039;s why I said your foundations, your proof of concept, all of this stuff is so important, because it doesn&#039;t matter how good you are at ads and everything, it matters what raw materials you have to work with. Because someone who doesn&#039;t know anything about ads but has some great raw materials, they&#039;re going to run laps around someone that knows the platform really well, but doesn&#039;t have any raw materials. This is why this is important, and we&#039;re really getting ourselves some really powerful raw materials here. Then question eight; what lies are they believing? Quite often, as you know throughout this program, people believe in different myths.


Different niches have different fallacies that they believe in and an example would be the bodybuilding market, how it trended up really high and everyone&#039;s taking tons of supplements and everyone was eating tons and doing lots of supplements. And now, the opposite advice has come out, which is, &quot;Well, you should fast until like 1 p.m. and you shouldn&#039;t take any supplements at all. It&#039;s kind of changed completely. So this is a really powerful thing to understand for your niche because it makes absolutely dangerous ads. When we&#039;re able to call up something like that, some big lie that everyone&#039;s believing and we&#039;re able to make an argument for it, that the opposite is true, those ads just ... they are savage. Because you&#039;re pretty much telling everyone in the whole industry that they believe in a lie.


No one likes to believe in these things. So if you found out what these things are, write them down here, and you can listen to your strategy session calls, you can go back through your worksheets, you can go back through all the work you&#039;ve done, and you really want to think ... What lies and myths is my niche believing? And then why are they believing these lies? So it&#039;s all very well that they are believing them, but why? Write it down. How have you generated your strategy sessions with this niche so far? If you&#039;ve got a proof of concept, which means you&#039;ve got three paying clients, that means you have done about 20 or more strategy sessions. If you did those, well you would&#039;ve had to do something to get them. What did you do? Write that down here. It&#039;s important that we understand this information when it comes to creating these ads.


What has and hasn&#039;t worked when it comes to generating strategy sessions with this niche? What things did you do that worked really well? And then what things did you do that worked okay? And what things did you do that just absolutely bombed? Write them all down. Now what I want you to do is look at your current clients, so the people who signed up with you. You should have at least three of them. What similarities do they all share? Now this is a really fascinating thing to look at because when you start getting clients, when you can step back and look at them, you&#039;ll notice that they all share some similarities and some traits. It&#039;s the same with everyone&#039;s clients, and you want to really think about it. What do they share in common? What makes them similar? You want to write this down; what traits do they share?


And then how would you describe your clients? So this isn&#039;t your niche. This is the customers and the clients you have. How would you describe them specifically? And then that&#039;s from your perspective, what about from their perspective? How would they describe themselves? I know they&#039;re within a niche, but how would these particular people who signed up with you describe themselves? And then, question 13. Look at the people you had strategy sessions with that said, &quot;No.&quot; So before we were looking at the people that said, &quot;Yes.&quot; Now we&#039;re looking at the people who said, &quot;No&quot; to you, and you&#039;ll know who these people are because they said &quot;No&quot; to you and you&#039;ll have their strategy session recordings. So what traits do they share? Maybe they all had a similar objection.


Or maybe they all had a similar attitude, or maybe their businesses were all similar, or maybe there was ... There is always something similar between people who do something and people who don&#039;t do something. Well, really observe that. What is it? And how would you describe the people who said, &quot;No&quot;? How would you define that group? And then how do you think they would describe themselves? It&#039;s very important here because we have a niche but there&#039;s something different between the people who signed up and the people who didn&#039;t sign up. So there&#039;s a niche within a niche, and we&#039;re really trying to find out what divides this here. And then what is your offer? Describe it below. You will know what it is because it&#039;s your offer, and you should&#039;ve sold it three times. So write it down, describe it. Then what result is this offer designed to create? Describe it below.


What&#039;s the desired situation that this offer is designed to generate? What is the goal that you&#039;re trying to get for your clients? Describe it. How would you describe your offer, or how do you describe your offer on the strategy sessions that were successful in signing up clients? Now this is a really, really powerful question. Now, I know I got you to describe your offer here in your own words, however, what I want you to do now is look at the strategy session recordings from the people who signed up. You should have at least three of them. What I want you to do is go to the particular section where you described your offer; this is towards the end of the sales call. I want you to listen to the exact words you said on those calls that were successful, and then you want to write down what you said there because this is important.


You might have said most of the time, pretty much 99% of the time, you will say it different on a sales call, than you&#039;ll say when prompted in a questionnaire like this. I want to know the actual language you used, the actual sales language you used live on the call, because that was successful, it got someone signed up, a really powerful question. 17. What objections did people have on the strategy session calls you did? So go back to your recordings and your script hypothesis worksheets, and look at the feedback. You should have a lot of calls that ended in a &quot;No.&quot; That&#039;s normal. Listen to them. What were the objections? You should have also taken notes on the script hypothesis worksheets. Well write them down below. What are the most common objections?


And then you want to just list them out first, and then next to each one you just want to give like: No.1, No.2, No.3, in terms of which one is most common and which one is least common. We want to understand these. These things are important when it comes to creating good ads. How did you handle these objections? You would&#039;ve handled the objections, well you should have at least, so listen to the sales calls. How did you handle them? Well you want to write your rebuttals to the most common objections below. This isn&#039;t how you would handle them now. This is how you handled them on the calls. And then what things is your niche interested in, that other people are not interested in? Some people are really interested in hundred-thousand-dollar home stereo systems. Not everyone is interested in those, most people think that&#039;s insane.


What are the things that your niche is interested in, that others aren&#039;t? What makes them unique in their interests? This is important because we want to appeal to these things in our ads. Because when we create ads we want to have these subtle things in there, that to a normal person, they don&#039;t think anything of it and they just don&#039;t even see it really, but to a true insider, it&#039;s the biggest deal. These subtleties make really good ads. They look like nothing to normal people, but they&#039;re everything to the people within the niche, so just think about these things. What are they? Every niche has them. Not a single niche in the world that doesn&#039;t. And then what interests are truly unique to them? Really powerful question. It&#039;s going to help us create some good ads.


And question 20: what are some hot topics that only an insider in your niche would know? What things do people keep telling you on the strategy session calls, that are unique specifically to this niche? What are some things that you&#039;ve heard on these strategy session calls that is just truly unique to this niche? Like if you were to do strategy session calls with other niches, you wouldn&#039;t hear these things. We want to know this because this is how we can show in our ads that we know. This is how we can show that we are an insider. We&#039;re not just some random dude or girl on Facebook just trying to target someone&#039;s niche. When you run ads on Facebook, when people see them, they&#039;re pretty much trying to quickly understand, &quot;Is this just another like, phony, or is this person the real deal?&quot;


Everyone is trying to conduct that analysis instantly when they&#039;re looking at an ad, and they can tell immediately by the language. When someone knows an insider secret, then they pretty much immediately get respect and everyone lets down their barriers and they start looking at the ad, because they&#039;re like, &quot;Oh, this guy&#039;s one of us,&quot; or &quot;This girl&#039;s one of us.&quot; However, when we don&#039;t really know any of these things, or worse yet, if we say something that they wouldn&#039;t say, then their guards go up and now, and they even just write on your ad, &quot;Nice try,&quot; or whatever. So this is important. We want to understand these things. And then what are the three most important things to people in your niche? State them below. If you were to ask the people within your niche, &quot;What things are most important to you?


If you were to state the number one most important thing to you, then the number two most important thing, then the number three most important thing, what would they be? And you want to state them in order from number one, the most important, to number three, the least important.&quot; Well, not the least important. The third, most important. Very important. We really want to understand their values. We want to understand what are the things that are just absolutely of importance, because when we understand their value system, then we know how to word our ads, and we know exactly what sort of things to appeal to in order to influence them, and get them to do what we want. Then question 22: what are the three least important things to people in your niche? State them in order.


So if you were to talk to your niche and asked them about the three least important things to them in their life and in their business, what would they say? It&#039;s important to understand these polar sides here because this gives us an accurate understanding of their value system, like how their ethics are really built-up, how their value systems are built up. And we understand the two sorts of binary poles that these people have, and then we&#039;re able to play with those two sides in our ads. When you learn how to do this stuff, my God, you&#039;re going to make a lot of money, because this is some next level sort of psychology and advertising stuff here. It&#039;s really easy because all of the stuff is all of the information you&#039;ve already got.


If you have a proof of concept you can&#039;t not have this stuff, because like I said, your proof of concept displays fractal nature, and by that I mean that within the proof of concept, we&#039;re going to be able to see all of these different things and they are going to be essential clues as to what&#039;s going to work on Facebook. All of the information that we could possibly want to know for Facebook ads, it&#039;s all sitting in your proof of concept. There&#039;s nowhere else where you can get it from. It&#039;s only in there, and that&#039;s why it&#039;s important to do. It&#039;s not just important to do, it&#039;s compulsory. You can&#039;t do it any other way. So what I want you to do, is pause this video right now and complete this worksheet.


Download it as a Google doc, you can download it as a PDF first, then you can open up this link here, save it to your Google Drive, edit it and take your time to thoroughly answer all of these questions. The information that you put in here is going to give us everything that we need. It&#039;s all the raw materials we could possibly need to create some seriously powerful Facebook ads. So pause the video now and make sure you go and do that. Now that we&#039;ve extracted all that information, it&#039;s time to start writing your ads, and first we will look at the structure of our campaign and then we&#039;ll start crafting the ads themselves. But before we do that, it&#039;s really important that we understand the structure, because once you get your head around the structure then it&#039;s easy to flesh everything out and create the different ads.


This is what I call the perfect Facebook structure. I call it Facebook&#039;s Golden Mean,&quot; and this is the architecture of a perfect campaign. So you remember the mistake that most people make when it comes to Facebook ads? And this is it, I explained it in one of the previous modules. So why people fail with Facebook ads? Facebook&#039;s algorithm is a natural selection machine that&#039;s constantly optimizing. In order to optimize, the algorithm needs variation, and without variation the algorithm will jam and your ads will stop getting traffic, and fail faster than you can imagine. This is why everyone fails for Facebook ads. They have one ad. They write one angle and then they have one image for that. Then they select one audience, and typically it&#039;s an audience with hardly anyone in it, and then that&#039;s what they have.


They have one possible combination of variables. One. The last thing the algorithm wants is this, so this is why people fail. It might work, but it will only work really for three days tops and then there are things failing. So when it comes to Facebook ads, like I&#039;ve said, variation is key. What we want to do is have multiple large audiences for targeting, so we want to have lots of them, and then we want to have multiple ad angles, so with different messages, different ways of saying what we have to offer, and then we want to have multiple images per ad. So within each ad angle, we want to have different images to go with it, because this means that we&#039;ve got multiple images for an ad and then multiple ads for each audience. It gives us three layers of variation. When we do this right, we have about 600 different combinations of variables.


However, how most people use Facebook, they have one combination. That means they either get it right or they don&#039;t. Most of the time they get it wrong. Even if they do get it right, well it&#039;s short-lived. It&#039;ll only work for three or four days. So one strategy is so much better than the other. It&#039;s like night and day in comparison. We want to load up Facebook&#039;s algorithm with multiple audiences, multiple ad angles, and multiple ad images so that it can optimize to find the perfect combinations for the current environment. This is what we do. We have the multiple audiences, multiple ad angles, and multiple ad images, and then we load it all into Facebook and then Facebook&#039;s algorithm optimizes for the perfect combination in the current environment. You can just sort of picture it like this.


You can see on the right-hand side of the screen we&#039;ve got that little red dot going around and it&#039;s changing all of these different things. It&#039;s flicking between different variations. It&#039;s trying to piece one ad angle with one particular image and in one audience, and it&#039;s flicking through all of the possible combinations, and it&#039;s seeing what works and what doesn&#039;t, and it knows what works because people click on it. It knows what doesn&#039;t work &#039;cause people don&#039;t click on it. So it&#039;s an amazing tool. It&#039;s constantly shuffling through these different variables and trying to find the right one. But the question that you probably have, is how much variation do we really need to have? Do I sit down and spend half a year creating 400 different ads? Do I need 1,000 images? Well, how many audiences? Just how much variation?


We know that we need it but how much? Well, I came up with the perfect ratio of variables so that we can get huge variation with minimal work and time. This is what I call Facebook&#039;s Golden Mean. So Facebook&#039;s Golden Mean is the term that we use to describe the perfect balance of a variation required to launch a campaign, and here it is. This is the architecture of the Facebook Golden Mean. Five unique ad angles. Now, ad angles is like the message, the text that we write. It&#039;s like the headline and the copy, so we have five unique angles, different ways of appealing to our audience, and then we want them to be different. We don&#039;t just change the headline, we don&#039;t just make one shorter, one longer. We want to truly have different angles, because different things appeal to different people.


Then we want to have four images per unique ad angle. So the five angles, four images within each one, and we want them to be unique for each one. Then we want to have 30 audience interests with at least 50,000 users in each audience. So we don&#039;t really want to go with audiences that have 1,000 or 10,000. We want ones that are at least 50,000 and then we want 30 of them. When we do this, this gives us 600 possible combinations of audience, message, image, variables. When most people have one combination, we have 600. That means we have 599 times more chance of winning and making profit than everyone else on the platform. I don&#039;t know about you, but I quite like having 599 times the chances that other people do. This means that we need to create five ad angles and find four images for each ad angle.


And we&#039;ve extracted the fractal patterns from the proof of concept, and now we have everything we need. But how do we know what to write in the ads? We&#039;ve got all of the raw materials from that questionnaire, but how do we actually know what to put in the ads? How do we know what to write? Well, I&#039;m going to show you in this next part of the video: How to Hypnotize a Swan. The basics of copywriting and direct response. This is a powerful section of this video. It&#039;s really going to show you how to create ads that get a response and get the people you want to, to take action. When it comes to writing great Facebook ads, you need to know the basics of copywriting and direct response. If you&#039;re thinking what&#039;s copywriting and what&#039;s direct response here&#039;s just a quick, simple definition for you.


Copywriting is the art and science of writing copy, which is words used on webpages, ads, and promotional materials, etc. â€” so basically just words â€” that sells your product or service and convinces prospects or prospective customers to take action. Put simply, copywriting is salesmanship in print. This is funny, because when I first got started in business, I heard different people talk about copywriting and I was like, &quot;What is this copywriting thing?&quot; And I honestly thought copywriting was that little &quot;c&quot; at the bottom of a website that has the &quot;c&quot; and then the circle around it and it says &quot;copyright&quot;. I thought that was copywriting and I kept wondering why copywriting was so important and making people so much money. Then I found out that it was actually writing ads, is what people call copywriting.


A lot of people think that you need to be a good marketer or a good English speaker or a good any of these things to be ... or a creative person to create ads. All of that stuff is bullshit. The best advertiser is always going to be a salesman, someone who sold the thing. And that is you, because you&#039;ve been doing the strategy session calls and you should have three paying customers. So nobody can write ads better than you when it comes to your thing. Because all copywriting is, is salesmanship in print. It&#039;s like taking that salesperson and it&#039;s just putting them in written text form instead of live human-over-the-phone form. That&#039;s all it is. Copywriting is just salesmanship in print and then direct response. Direct response marketing is a type of marketing that elicits a specific measured response from a person to an ad.


This is done with longer-styled ads that make a specific offer to a specific type of person or niche. The ads contain a strong call to action that is measurable, so that feedback can be collected and adjustments made. This is really just an ad that&#039;s targeted to a particular type of niche and it has an offer for something. It might be a free video, it might be a free case study, it might be a free report, a free PDF, it might be a free phone call. It has an offer of something that&#039;s typically for free, and it&#039;s designed to get somebody to take an action. Because I&#039;m sure you&#039;ve seen ads on your TV before about Coke and stuff and it&#039;s just got people, pretty topless people pretty much dancing to some random music, drinking Coke. That is not a direct response ad. That&#039;s a weird ad, that they have no way of knowing whether that works or not.


When they run that ad, they literally have no idea. If sales go up, they can&#039;t say it&#039;s because of that ad, it&#039;s much more likely to be from something else. There&#039;s no way to actually track it, so it&#039;s just really shooting blindfolded and it&#039;s not what we want to do. We always want to use direct response. The king of direct response advertising is a guy, or was a guy, called David Ogilvy, and there&#039;s a picture of him to the left. David Ogilvy, he started Ogilvy and Mather, which, I think is the biggest advertising agency in the entire world still today. If he was still alive today, he&#039;d have many, many billions. He had billions even way back then, and he was one of the richest dudes there was. What&#039;s fascinating about his story, is that ... and this will just make this entire point completely crystal clear to you.


David Ogilvy started off selling ovens door-to-door, like cooking ovens. He would just go door-to-door, knocking on people&#039;s doors and try to sell them these things, and obviously it was very hard. Whenever you&#039;re door-knocking trying to sell something, it&#039;s very hard, and it&#039;s brutal, but David Ogilvy was the best salesman. He started off poorly, but then he figured out how to do it and he became the best salesman by a long shot for this company. Then he became so good at it, that the owners of the company, they paid him to put together a training book for the other sales reps at the company, to teach them how they could sell it. So David Ogilvy created this training manual and then he gave it to all of the other people, and then they were able to sell really well, as well.


Then what happened is, that people started hearing about this training manual that David Ogilvy had created, and people started hearing about how powerful it was, because it was a really powerful piece of training for sales. People were constantly trying to get their hands on it. Different people from different companies were trying to buy them off people, and it was rumored that everyone wanted it, even massive advertising agencies on Madison Avenue back then. And then one of the Madison Avenue advertising agencies got a hold of this training manual, they read it and they&#039;re like, &quot;We need to hire this guy. This guy is smart.&quot;


So they hired him and they made him a partner at their advertising firm on Madison Avenue, and then he was so good pretty much immediately within his first year of working at that firm, that he was the largest partner at the entire advertising firm because he was a good salesman. He had learned from selling door-to-door. He was battle hardened and tested. So when he came into Madison Avenue, he tore everyone up and sold more stuff than anyone else, and he became the go-to partner in all of Madison Avenue at this one firm. Then, he got so good that he pretty much figured out that he didn&#039;t even really need the advertising agency and he quit and he started his own one. When he started his own one, he called it Ogilvy and Mather, and all of his clients that he had at the other one, left just to come over to him.


So pretty much immediately Ogilvy and Mather was a success, and then it grew so quickly to become the biggest advertising agency in the entire world. So that&#039;s his story and he started selling these ovens door-to-door. So how was this guy able to create such good ads. Why did everyone want him to create ads for them? And his ads that he&#039;s written were like ... these ads were revolutionary ads. They were like the best working ads that anyone had ever seen back at that time, and still today, his ads are better than most people&#039;s ads today. But how was he so good? What made him good? Well, what made him good was that he was a salesman first. He sold first, and then he learned how to write ads, and all he did when he wrote ads is just do what he did when he was selling. He just did it with written words instead of speaking, and that&#039;s all advertising is.


It&#039;s just salesmanship in print, and it&#039;s a very powerful lesson to understand because I know a lot of people, they go from sales and then they put a different hat on and they change their voice and the way they write and everything when they&#039;re trying to write ads, and that is not what you do. It&#039;s the same voice, you&#039;re talking to the same person. You want to just treat it as salesmanship in print. Here is a video of David Ogilvy, which I&#039;ve gotten. This is a really old one but it&#039;s an awesome one, so I&#039;m just going to play this for you right now and it&#039;s important to watch because this is way back then, and this is Ogilvy himself, and he tells you about the power of direct response advertising.

David Ogilvy:
I wish I could be with you today in the flesh, as they say. Unfortunately, I&#039;m in India. Ever been in India? Very hot. If you don&#039;t mind, I&#039;m going to take off my coat. You know, in the advertising community today there are two worlds; your world of direct response advertising and that other world, the world of general advertising. These two worlds are on a collision course. You direct response people know what kind of advertising works and what doesn&#039;t work. You know it to a dollar. The general advertising people don&#039;t know. You know that two-minute commercials on television are more effective, more cost-effective than 10-second commercials or 30-second commercials.


You know that [inaudible 00:56:00] time on television sells more than prime time. In print advertising, you know that long copy sells more than short copy. You know that headlines and copy about the product and its benefits sell more than cute headlines and poetic copy. You know it to a dollar. The general advertisers and their agencies know almost nothing for sure, because they cannot measure the results of their advertising. They worship at the altar of creativity, which really means originality, the most dangerous word in the lexicon of advertising. They opine that 30-commercials are more cost-effective than two-minute commercials. You know they&#039;re wrong.


In print advertising they opine that short commercials sell more than long copy. You know they&#039;re wrong. They indulge in entertainment. You know they&#039;re wrong. You know to a dollar. They don&#039;t. Why don&#039;t you tell them? Why don&#039;t you save them from their follies? For two reasons. First, because you&#039;re impressed by the fact that they&#039;re so big, and so well-paid, and so well-publicized. You are even perhaps impressed by their reputation for creativity, whatever that may mean. Second, you never meet them. You inhabit a different world. The chasm between direct response advertising and general advertising is wide.


On your side of the chasm, I see knowledge and reality. On the other side of the chasm, I see ignorance. You are the professionals. This must not go on. I predict that the practitioners of general advertising are going to start learning from your experience. They&#039;re going to start picking your brains. I see no reason why the direct response divisions of agencies should be separate from the main agencies. Some of you may remember when television people in agencies were kept separate. Wasn&#039;t that idiotic? I expect to see the direct response people become an integral part of all agencies. You have more to teach them, than they have to teach you. You have it in your power to rescue the advertising business from its manifold lunacies.


When I was 25, I took a correspondence course in direct mail. I bought it out of my own pocket from the Dartnell Corporation in Chicago. Direct response was my first love, and later, it became my secret weapon. When I started Ogilvy &amp; Mather in New York, nobody had heard of us, but we were airborne within six months and grew at record speed. How did we achieve that? By using my secret weapon; direct mail. Every four weeks, I sent personalized mailings to our new business prospects. And I was always amazed to discover how many of our clients had been attracted to Ogilvy &amp; Mather by those mailings. That was how we grew. Whenever I look at an advertisement in a magazine or a newspaper, I can tell at a glance whether the writer has had any direct response experience.


If he writes short copy or literary copy, it is obvious that he has never had the disciplines of writing direct response. If he has had that discipline, he wouldn&#039;t make those mistakes. Nobody should be allowed to create general advertising until he has served his apprenticeship in direct response. That experience will keep his feet on the ground for the rest of his life. You know, the trouble with many copywriters in general agencies is that they don&#039;t really think in terms of selling. They&#039;ve never written direct response, they&#039;ve never tasted blood. Until recently, direct response was the Cinderella of the advertising world, then came the computer and the credit card, and direct marketing exploded. You guys are coming to your own. Your opportunities are colossal.


In the audience today, there are heads of some general agencies. I offer you this advice. Insist that all your people; creative, media, account executives, that they&#039;re all trained in your direct response division. If you don&#039;t have such a division, make arrangements with a firm of direct marketing specialists to train your people. And make it a rule in your agency that no copy is ever presented to clients, before it has been vetted by a direct response expert. Ladies and gentlemen, I envy you. Your timing is perfect. You&#039;ve come into the direct response business at the right moment in history. You&#039;re on to a good thing. For 40 years, I&#039;ve been a voice crying in the wilderness, trying to get my fellow advertising practitioners to take direct response seriously. Today, my first love is coming to its own. You face a golden future.

Sam Ovens:
So that is that video from David Ogilvy. The reason why I wanted to show that to you. is because this is the guy who pretty much ... He used direct response advertising to take over the entire advertising industry, and the funny thing is, is that video is really old and really things are still the same today. Direct response is getting way more popular. Now with Facebook ads and online ads, we can actually track things and we can measure things, so we actually know if something works or if it doesn&#039;t work. However, most ads you see that people run, big companies run even today, they&#039;re not direct response ads.


Even the ads that people think are direct response, they&#039;re not really true direct response ads. That video, you will have learned some powerful listens. You first of all will have heard that David Ogilvy thinks that advertising is all about selling, it&#039;s not about creativity, and it&#039;s a huge myth that a lot of people believe. They believe that ads in marketing is all about creativity, and that couldn&#039;t be further from the truth. It&#039;s about selling, and the only way you really know how to sell is to have sold something, and once you&#039;ve sold something then you know how to sell something with an ad. It&#039;s pretty much the same way, you just use the written word instead of speaking.


And you&#039;ll notice in that video, David Ogilvy was a huge fan of direct mail and everything, which is why we&#039;ve included lump emails and stuff in our program, and you&#039;ll know that all of the advertising which we run is geared towards generating a response. Nothing we ever do has no core direction and no response, and we track everything. So this program really teaches you how to be a dangerously effective direct response copywriter. You&#039;ll also notice in that video David Ogilvy said that you know who knows direct response and you know who doesn&#039;t. Most of the time they write short ads, and this is fascinating. A lot of people they look at my ads, and they think it&#039;s too long. They think no one&#039;s going to read it. Or a lot of people that look at my webinar or all these different things and they think it&#039;s too long.


My webinar is like two and 1/2 hours, and some of my ads look like essays, they&#039;re so long. Some of my posts I do are so long. People just think, &quot;Oh, no one&#039;s going to read that, it&#039;s too long.&quot; But this is the biggest myth that exists in advertising. Long ads and long copy sells better than short ads and short copy every single time. Can you imagine doing a strategy session and having 10 minutes? You can&#039;t do it. You need at least 30, more like 45 minutes to an hour to do a strategy session. You need to take someone through those stages. The exact same thing is true with advertising, on Facebook and direct mail, with anything. You need to take someone through those critical stages. You need to take them through those stages before they&#039;re going to do anything.


When your ad isn&#039;t long enough, you&#039;re not able to do that, and that&#039;s why it&#039;s important. So when I&#039;m showing you these different ads and when you&#039;re creating your own ads, never ever think that it&#039;s too long. Generally, longer is better. You shouldn&#039;t just try and make it long for the sake of making it long, but you should use as many words as necessary to get somebody signed up. You should really sell from all the different angles, you should take someone through all the critical stages that you take them through on your strategy sessions. Another important thing which Ogilvy said in that video, is that it&#039;s all about sales, not creativity. He said that a lot of advertisers, they write cutesy headlines. This is true.


You see people, they run an ad and it&#039;s almost like they&#039;re trying to just get likes or they&#039;re just ... Well, a lot of them are just trying to do that, sadly. But it&#039;s like they&#039;re trying to just be creative or create something artsy, or cute, or they&#039;re just trying to get respect from people, and they just try and create these cute little things and they put different images on them, and it&#039;s not really saying anything. That&#039;s how you know someone isn&#039;t trained in direct response. That&#039;s how you know that the ad isn&#039;t going to work. So when you&#039;re creating your ads, don&#039;t try and be cutesy. Don&#039;t try and win the creativity awards and don&#039;t try and impress anyone or anything like that. You are just there to try and make a sale, and you don&#039;t need to worry about creativity and all of that.


It&#039;s all about selling. It&#039;s just in text form instead of phone form when you&#039;re speaking. Once you get your head around that, you&#039;ll be able to create really, really good ads. Advertising can really be divided by these two schools. Ogilvy said that back then, and the same is true today. The two schools of advertising really are general branding advertising, which is this over here on the left, and in direct response advertising, which is this over here on the right. So, branding advertising looks like this on the left. This blue image. It typically has a really big image and it&#039;s got people doing different things, and it pretty much doesn&#039;t say anything. This says this. It says, &quot;Designed by you, assembled in the USA.&quot; I mean, what the hell does that even mean?


Then it just has their logo and Motorola, and then it&#039;s just two people jumping into the water. What&#039;s that got to do with the phone? I don&#039;t know. This is general branding advertising. It&#039;s cutesy sort of stuff and it really is pointless, and there&#039;s no way to even measure if this works or not. It&#039;s got no call to action. We&#039;re not asking people to do anything, we&#039;re no offering them anything, but it just kinda looks cool. And then over here on the right, this is a direct response ad and this is one that Ogilvy wrote himself. It has an image, direct response ads can still have images, but you can tell direct response very clearly. It has a headline and then it has quite a lot of copy, and copy is the words. This one says, &quot;At 60 Miles An Hour, The Loudest Noise In This New Rolls-Royce Comes From The Electric Clock ... &quot; and then it goes on to sell this thing.


Then towards the end, there is a call to action and it says, &quot;If you would like the rewarding experience of driving this Rolls-Royce of beauty, write or telephone to ... &quot; and then it has a mailing address and it has a specific phone number. And what they did back in these days, because they didn&#039;t have online tracking and everything, they would provide different mailing addresses and different phone numbers. If the phone rang on this particular number, they knew that it came from this ad and if they sent it to this particular postage address, they know it came from this ad. And they would change the phone numbers and the addresses for each ad, and that was kind of their way of testing. Ogilvy was doing split testing and variations and all of the stuff with printed ads back then, and he was able to crush it with that.


These days, we get to use algorithms and Facebook and digital stuff, it&#039;s way easier for us to do and it gives us so much more power. But that is the difference. You&#039;ve got general branding advertising and direct response advertising. We use direct response advertising every single time. There is never an instance where we use anything else. We never run this type of advertising &#039;cause it is a total waste of money, and the only reason why people do advertising that this, is because dumb people end up in corporates that have never sold anything and never really been on the front lines themselves. They just kind of end up in this position in a corporate and they&#039;re like, &quot;Oh yeah, this ad looks cool. I like that. Yeah, let&#039;s run this.&quot;


And then they run it, and no one can track their advertising because it doesn&#039;t have a call to action, so they never get pulled up on it and they never get into trouble. If you could track their advertising, at least people would be fired in 24 hours, because everyone would know that it wasn&#039;t working. So this is why people keep running this sort of crap because no one knows whether it&#039;s working or not, so people can&#039;t really get into trouble for it. But with direct response, we know to a dollar, just like Ogilvy said. So we use direct response every time, all day long. This is the stuff that makes money. Now here&#039;s the basics of direct response, because it&#039;s important to understand the basics of direct response before you type any ads at all, because it will make a world of difference.


It&#039;ll make like 10 to 100 times difference in your ads and I&#039;m going to take you through the basics of it real quick. I provided this as a swipe file, or not a swipe file, a resource, which is available beneath this video for download, and it looks like this. Its just a simple PDF and it&#039;s three pages and it says, The Basics of Direct Response Advertising. So I&#039;ll walk you through this right now. First of all, it&#039;s trackable, so that is when somebody responds you know which ad and which media was responsible for generating their response. In our case, with Facebook ads, we track everything so we have this covered. The first thing that makes something direct response is it&#039;s trackable, and it&#039;s measurable.


So since you know which ads are being responded to, and how many sales you&#039;ve reached from each one, you can measure exactly how effective each ad is. You then drop or change ads that are not giving you a return on investment, and this is why we have KPIs and the Polaris Star, which is our ROI and these other numbers. When we have ads that don&#039;t work, which always happens, it&#039;s fine. We know what ones they are, we turn them off. Those are what we call red swans. When we have ads that work, and we know because we can measure them with our KPIs, we start scaling them. We leave them on. Those are our blue swans. So this is a key piece of direct response. It must be trackable, it must be measurable. Then it uses compelling headlines and copy, so direct response marketing has a compelling message of strong interest to your chosen prospects.


It uses attention-grabbing headlines with strong sales copy that is salesmanship in print. So it reads totally different than a normal creative person&#039;s ad. A creative person&#039;s ad is just trying to be cutesy and stuff, and try to write like cutesy sort of copy and headlines. A direct response advertiser is just going straight for the throat and creating ads designed to sell. So they often use long headlines, they often use long copy, and they&#039;re really trying to make a sale, so it often looks a little bit more aggressive and a lot more forward than a normal person&#039;s ad because it&#039;s trying to do a job, it&#039;s not just trying to make somebody smile. It targets a specific audience or niche. So like that Motorola ad that I showed you before, it was just probably targeting everyone.


I mean, you may as well when your ad&#039;s that bad. So when you&#039;re using direct response, you&#039;re always going for something specific, so you&#039;re targeting prospects within specific verticals or geographic zones or niche markets, and the ad aims to appeal to a narrow target market. That&#039;s what we&#039;re doing, and that&#039;s why in week one, I got you to pick a niche. And it&#039;s why we also have one niche, one offer, and we&#039;re going for one result. The way I&#039;ve gotten you to design and engineer and architect your consulting business, is geared ... It would put a smile on David Ogilvy&#039;s face if he saw how I have got you to engineer your entire business. I&#039;ve engineered it so that it matches perfectly with direct response. If you&#039;ve built it properly, you will be able to make a lot of money with the stuff that I&#039;m going to show you.


So it makes a specific offer. Now I&#039;m on page two. So usually the ad makes a specific value-packed offer, and often the aim is not necessarily to sell anything from the ad, but to simply get the prospect to take the next action such as requesting a free report. This is exactly what we do with our fragmentation funnel. We&#039;re taking someone from our Facebook ad, and then we&#039;re pointing them over to our funnel, where we&#039;re getting their email ... First of all, we&#039;re selling the click, we get someone to click, then we get their email address, then after that we get them to watch the video, then after that we get them to apply for the strategy session, and only then do we start selling them. So this is truly direct response in nature because we&#039;re making something specific, we&#039;re offering something specific every stage of the funnel.


It demands a response. So, direct response advertising has a call to action compelling the prospect to do something specific. It also includes a means of response and capture of these responses. We have this. Our call to action is to watch our case study video or our value video, and we&#039;re offering something for free to them. And in [inaudible 01:15:51] of a response, we&#039;re capturing their email address. That&#039;s what we&#039;re doing. Then it&#039;s generally multi-step and short-term follow-up. So, in exchange for capturing the prospect&#039;s details, valuable education and information on the prospect&#039;s problem is offered. The information should carry with it a second irresistible offer tied to whatever the next step you want the prospect to take, such as calling to schedule an appointment or coming into a [inaudible 01:16:19] store. Textbook stuff, we&#039;ve got this exact thing.


So when they enter in their info, we&#039;re showing them a valuable, educational video on their problem and we&#039;re providing value, and at the end of that we provide an offer to schedule an appointment with us. So we&#039;re doing exactly this. Then there&#039;s typically maintenance follow-up of unconverted leads. So people who do not respond within the short-term follow-up period, may have many reasons for not maturing into buyers immediately, and there is value in this bank of slow to mature prospects. They should continue hearing from you once to several times a month, and this is what I&#039;m going to teach you in week six. So all the people that opt in for your value video, but they don&#039;t schedule an appointment, which is most people, it&#039;s like 95 to 90% of people. That&#039;s a lot of people.


We have a method for sending them something once each month just like Ogilvy did in that video I just showed you. This sort of brews the pot. We&#039;re just stirring the pot and people start coming out of that, they&#039;ll start coming out of the woodwork and scheduling strategy sessions with us, and that&#039;s really something that I&#039;m going to show you in week six, specifically. So we&#039;ve really ticked all of the boxes when it comes to using a direct response, as we can see here. But anytime you&#039;re looking at an ad, you want to sort of think, &quot;Is this direct response or is this not?&quot; And if it is missing any of these things, then it&#039;s not direct response. If it&#039;s not direct response, then it probably isn&#039;t working. Amazing. You will notice that most ads really don&#039;t work. They&#039;re really just aimless.


And I know a lot of people get deluded by these ads, because you see them all the time on the TV and in magazines and stuff, and you think ... I was like this too. I thought that&#039;s how ads should be; kind of cute and hardly any text and just nice images and stuff, and then I started running some of those ads when I first got started in business and I just got crickets. I got nothing. Then I had to go and learn all of this direct response stuff and it changed the game for me. So make sure that you don&#039;t fall into that trap. Make sure you use direct response every time. Now, I&#039;ve provided you with some resources here so that you can really understand what makes a good direct response ad. So first of all, I provided you with an archive of some of David Ogilvy&#039;s best ads, the guy you just saw on the video because he was an award-winning copywriter.


So you just go to consulting.com/ogilvy or you can click the link on this resource here, and you can see here that he has a whole bunch of his ads. We can click view swipe and we can see this whole ad. So he wrote a whole bunch of different ads, but you can see how long these are. So he always had a headline and he always had quite a lot of text, and he was always making an offer at the end, like, &quot;If you&#039;d like to drive a Rolls-Royce or Bentley get in touch with us,&quot; and he would always have a call to action. This was way back in the day before computers and stuff were even around, and this guy is a masterful copywriter. If you want to learn how to write good ads, read this guy&#039;s ads. When you want to read something, just read through these ads.


Even if you&#039;re not really trying to create an ad yourself, just read these ads anyway, because it will start to teach you how to create awesome ads. Or, this is probably a good ad to read on how to create a good ad, and it&#039;s called, &quot;How To Create Advertising That Sells.&quot; He provides, I think it&#039;s 40 tips or something on how to create advertising that sells, and a lot of people think that this ad here was the best ad Ogilvy ever wrote in his entire life. So I do recommend reading this one because it&#039;s an awesome ad. I think this one ad alone made him more than a billion dollars, but not only that, you&#039;re going to learn how to create good ads just by reading this ad anyway, so you&#039;re killing two birds with one stone.


Then, I provided you with a collection of the five best ads I have ever run on Facebook. This resource is called Five $1 million FB Ads Swipefile.&quot; You can see the text here. So it&#039;s available for download in the resources section. Five $1m ads swipefile. It&#039;s a PDF. You can download it, it looks like this, and here I walk you through five ads that have made me more than $1 million each. This isn&#039;t just a fancy headline or something. I&#039;m not just calling it a million-dollar ad to try and make it sound cool or anything. These have legitimately made me more than $1 million each. Some of them have made me multiple millions. Just these ads. Single ads that I&#039;m showing you right now. No difference. There was not a single word different in them, not a single image different in them.


These are the actual ones. This is a screenshot of the actual thing, and these ads made me more than $1 million each. I&#039;m giving you five of them here, just so you can look and see how I did it. What you&#039;ll notice is I use direct response just like Ogilvy does, really. I have long headlines and I have long copy. You have to click &quot;see more&quot; to read how much text I actually wrote. So I provided you with a screenshot of the ad, and then the headline, so this one&#039;s called, &quot;Sam Ovens Shares A Simple Process Of Starting A Consulting Business And Scaling It To 7 Figures Quickly,&quot; and then the body copy, which is the text here that goes at the top of the ad. I provided you with word-for-word the entire ad, and you can read through this stuff. You&#039;ll notice that my ads are pretty long, and they all include pretty long headlines, and they&#039;re all pretty aggressive ads.


By that I don&#039;t mean they&#039;re bad or mean or anything like that, I mean they&#039;re ads that are trying to do a job. We&#039;re not just trying to be cutesy here. We&#039;re trying to get customers, get clicks. We&#039;re trying to solicit action. So here this one&#039;s called, &quot;9 Millionaire Consultants Were Created With This Advice. Ignore At Your Peril.&quot; And a lot of you have probably seen these ads, a lot of you probably clicked on these ads and purchased this program because of these ads. So that&#039;s pretty funny, and that&#039;s how you know these ads work, because they sold you, yourself. And as you can see, they&#039;re always long. Always headlines and always long. Here&#039;s another one. &quot;How A 26-year-old Punk Started A Consulting Business In His Parents&#039; Garage, Moved To Manhattan And Made $10 Million In Four Years.&quot;


And this one&#039;s my longest one, I think. It&#039;s a aggressive headline and then you can see how much text is in this thing. It&#039;s like an essay. This one ad here, I think it&#039;s still running. All [inaudible 01:24:05] so far, this ad&#039;s made me more than three million; one single ad, more than three million bucks from this. It&#039;s the best one I have ever written, this. So you can see, it&#039;s not ... I tell a story, I talk about how I used to be in debt and everything and then I talk about the struggles and everything and then I talk about how I figured it out, then I had my breakthrough, and then I talk about the lessons I learned. Then I make a call to action at the end. I&#039;m like, &quot;If you would like to learn exactly how I did this, then register for this webinar for free or register for this free case study for free,&quot; and I give them the link. That&#039;s my call to action.


So this ad here works really well because this is exactly how I did a strategy session. A strategy session always starts off asking them about their current situation, and this is what I start off here. I talk about the current situation. Then I talk about the struggles; stressed out of my mind, all this stuff. I&#039;m talking about the pain and then I&#039;m talking about the things that I tried to do and they didn&#039;t work, so that&#039;s sort of the blockages, what things were blocking me. So we&#039;ve got the current situation, the desired situation, and the things that are blocking me. Talked about them all. Then I talk about the desired situation, which is what I achieved, then I talk about achieving it and hitting these goals.


So it&#039;s a story of transformation, of someone going from a current situation to a desired situation, smashing through the barriers in between, and achieving the transformation that everyone wants to achieve, and then I share how I did it. If you think about it, this is precisely how a strategy session happens, then towards the end I get them to take action. Here&#039;s another ad. &quot;How Did These 9 Entrepreneurs Make 7 Figures And Get On This Private Jet?&quot; Another long ad here, and I&#039;ve given you all the copies, you can have a look. And here&#039;s the fifth and final ad: &quot;Advice For Consultants Struggling To Get Clients From A Consultant Who Has Too Many.&quot; Another long ad, this one crushed it as well, and all of these ads made more than a million bucks each. So that is a good resource.


Now, you don&#039;t have permission to copy these ads exactly. It wouldn&#039;t really work well for you if you did, because everyone would know it was me, because I&#039;ve issued over 100 million impressions to these things. You never want to just copy a swipefile because it doesn&#039;t work. You have to write it yourself. You want to use these sorts of things for clues and ideas and inspiration, but you have to write your own ads. Don&#039;t farm this job out to someone else. Everyone that does that, their businesses always struggle. The practitioner needs to be writing the copy because you&#039;re the only one that knows. Nobody else can know your niche as well as you do. And if they do, then you shouldn&#039;t be in your niche. You should be the practitioner, you should know everything there is to know about your niche, and that&#039;s how you&#039;re able to write killer ads.


All of this information here, I extracted it out of that Extracting Fractal Patterns From Your Proof of Concept worksheet. This is why we took the time to go through all of this stuff, to really pull out the gold from all of your research, all your strategy sessions. With this stuff here, we can craft it into some awesome ads, and that&#039;s all we&#039;re doing. So far we&#039;ve covered Ogilvy&#039;s ads, you should read those. I gave you my five $1 million Facebook ads, you can look at those, and then I&#039;ve also given you a collection of 1,000 winning headlines. So, coming up with headlines is important. The headline is probably the most important thing in the whole ad. That is like the title. When you think about how you read a newspaper, you don&#039;t start reading the text in the newspaper.


You read the headlines, which is the bold stuff. Everyone skims through a newspaper and they&#039;re only looking for headlines. Once they see a headline that catches their attention, then they will read the text, and Facebook works the same way. People are just scrolling through their newsfeed, scrolling on their phone, and they&#039;re just scanning the headlines. Then once they see one that gets their attention, then they will put in the effort to read the text, so headlines are really important. To help you with those, I&#039;ve given you a swipefile of a thousand winning headlines. This is available for download in the resources section. Otherwise, you can just click this link on The Basics of Direct Response Advertising resource, you can click on this. You can open it up.


I suggest you use Google Docs for this so you can download the Excel file and then you can click this link here. Save it into Google Docs because then you can just edit it online. So this is going to be a powerful resource for you when you&#039;re creating your ads, because over here on the left you can see it says &quot;headline swipes.&quot; Well here, I have a whole collection of different headlines that have worked really well. I&#039;ve collected these from my own ads, and also from looking at a whole bunch of other ads. Every time I really see a good ad, I will add the headline into this spreadsheet here. The one I have that works the best for me all the time, and that&#039;s why it says, &quot;control almost always&quot; is How To ... and then something. How-to headlines are awesome. If you can write a how-to headline, you should. They&#039;re really powerful.


What I mean by a how-to headline, imagine all the YouTube videos that say, &quot;How To ... &quot; do this or &quot;How To ... &quot; do this. Humans always want to see those how-to things. So how-to ads are really good too. Like, How To Lose Weight, or How To Get Off Of Porn Addiction. I have one guy in upper-level consulting right now, whose niche is porn addiction, and he&#039;s a consultant on getting unaddicted to porn. His headline is like, How To Deal With Your Porn Addiction, or How To Become Porn-free, and it works really well. So the how-to headlines always work really well. Another one is an amazing secret or one weird tip or trick, or food top 10, 3 big, 7 secrets of. Numbered lists work pretty well because it&#039;s in our human nature to want to know what these 3 things are. We&#039;re like, &quot;Oh, I need to know what the 3 things are.&quot;


Numbered lists work really well. Quickly and easily, you can see all of these different things. So you can scroll through here just to get ideas. Now, what I typically do when I&#039;m running an ad, is I&#039;ll kinda scroll through here and I&#039;ll get an idea. And I&#039;ll show you that I actually use this thing because I got an idea from here and it ended up creating a million-dollar ad for me. So advice for ... Let me find this. So, I saw this headline here. I was scrolling through, and I saw this one. &quot;Advice To Wives Whose Husbands Don&#039;t Save Money, By A Wife.&quot; Now look at this. Here is the Five $1 million Ad swipefile, number five I&#039;m pretty sure. &quot;Advice For Consultants Struggling To Get Clients From A Consultant Who Has Too Many.&quot; So look at that. We&#039;ll compare these two things here.


You can say how I got this idea from here. I read it, &quot;Advice To Wives Whose Husbands Don&#039;t Save Money, By A Wife.&quot; &quot;Advice For Consultants Struggling To Get Clients From A Consultant Who Has Too Many.&quot; You see? I got the idea from here and then I adjusted it for my niche and everything and it crushed it, it blew it out of the park. Because if it worked somewhere else, it&#039;s like fractals right? If it worked somewhere else, then it&#039;s probably going to work somewhere else again. But the trick is to change things around in it. Use the structure of it. Use the fractal pattern but don&#039;t use the exact thing as a copy, because when you use the exact thing as a copy it won&#039;t work, but when you just learn to extract the fractal pattern out of it, and re-jig it to work for you, it works amazingly well.


So you can say that I actually use this thing every time to create ads, and there&#039;s other ones in here that I&#039;ve used too. You&#039;ll probably find throughout here you&#039;ve seen a lot of different headlines. So there legitimately is a ... there&#039;s more than a thousand headlines in here. There&#039;s 1,214 headlines, so no one should have issues coming up with headlines because I&#039;ve literally given you more than a thousand of them. You&#039;ll notice a lot of these down here, the numbered ones, they&#039;re a lot to do with sex and all of this stuff, it&#039;s because these headlines are from the front covers of Cosmos magazine. Cosmos magazine is known to have really good copywriters, so the people who write the front cover of Cosmos, they are some of the best copywriters there are. So if you look at the front page of them, they&#039;ve got really good headlines.


Now obviously you&#039;re not going to be using these different, you know, &quot;Bad Girl Sex&quot; headlines and all of this stuff. All of these are here because it gives you an idea of what works, because we&#039;re never just using these headlines as they are. We&#039;re changing them around and using them for us, so they&#039;re just to give you ideas, not to just copy, and that&#039;s why there are all of these different ones down here, just in case you wondered. All the numbered ones are from Cosmos magazine and the other ones are not from Cosmos magazine. So that&#039;s how it works. What you want to do is scroll through here, get some ideas, and then what you can do is you can type your idea next to it. So I could start writing, &quot;How To ... &quot; I can&#039;t type in here at the moment because I&#039;m not logged in, but you will be able to.


When you type in here, you can create your iteration of the successful headlines swipe in this column here, and then it will show you a character count, how many characters your headline is. You want to make sure that you&#039;re within the character count for Facebook headlines, and if you want to know what that number is just Google search it. &quot;What is the character limit for Facebook headlines?&quot; It actually changes all the time, so I don&#039;t want to say it in this video, just in case like in two weeks something changes and people are like, &quot;Oh, it&#039;s not this anymore.&quot; So just Google it, Facebook will say what it is. Just when you&#039;re creating your headlines, make sure you&#039;re within that character count. Then you&#039;re going to come up with your different headlines and then as you test different ones, you can write whether it wins or loses.


So you just type &quot;win&quot; or &quot;lose&quot; so you can keep track of them, so you don&#039;t come back to one you&#039;ve used before that didn&#039;t work, and so that you know ones that do work so you can create new variations of them or keep using them. So this is a powerful tool that I have provided you with, and then we go to ... I&#039;ve also given you a collection of Facebook ads for example purposes. You can get this by clicking this link in this resource. Otherwise you can just go to consultant.com/fb-swipe and if we go here, you&#039;ll see that I&#039;ve taken screenshots of a whole bunch of different ads and you can click on them and see the whole ad. Now these ads aren&#039;t necessarily good. These aren&#039;t good ads. I&#039;ve just taken screenshots of lots of different ads I see.


Sometimes I don&#039;t read them, I don&#039;t even know if they are good or not, but I always like to have a swipe file of a whole bunch of different ads so I can come in here and get ideas, I want to look at how people are doing images, how people are doing text, how people are having their core directions, all that stuff. So if you go to this swipefile here, you can scroll through here and look at a whole bunch of different ads. There&#039;s a few hundred in here, and these should give you ideas about what you can do with your ads. So whenever you&#039;re in a creativity slump, just come into the swipefiles and have a scroll around. With a thousand headlines, I&#039;ve given you my best ads and then with all of these too, and with Ogilvy&#039;s ads too, there&#039;s a lot to choose from. You shouldn&#039;t have any problems creating your ads.


Then, if you want to go a step further, here are some books. Now, you don&#039;t need to read these books to create your ads. Let me be clear about that. The information I&#039;m giving you in this module alone, in this video alone, is more than enough to create your ads. However, direct response is such a powerful skill, it&#039;s one of those skills like sales, that has been responsible for a lot of the money I&#039;ve made, like a huge amount of it. Knowing how to sell has helped me more than I can possibly explain in words, and knowing direct response has helped me a lot too. So if you do want to learn more about it, I&#039;ve given you the best three books I know on direct response advertising. First one is by Ogilvy and it&#039;s called Ogilvy On Advertising. You go to consultant.com/ogilvy book, you can buy it on Amazon here for 15 bucks and it will make you a lot more money than that, good return on investment.


The second one is Scientific Advertising, by Claude Hopkins, so My life In Advertising And Scientific Advertising, that&#039;s the one. Now Scientific Advertising, it&#039;s called this because this is how these guys treat it. They treat it as a scientific experiment, just how we treat our consulting businesses. We don&#039;t just wing things and guess. We test, we measure, and then we iterate and we try different variables and we find out what works and what doesn&#039;t. So this talks about using the scientific method for advertising, which is what we do. It will teach you a lot. Claude Hopkins was an extremely wealthy and prominent direct response advertiser as well.


Now, you&#039;ll notice that these guys are from back in the day. These are like old-school guys. The truth is that there was way better advertisers back then, than there is now. Things have gotten noisy now and it&#039;s hard to really tell like who&#039;s good and who&#039;s not, and actually, most people aren&#039;t. So if you want to learn this stuff, it always pays to go back to these classics because these are still the best copywriting books ever written. And then Breakthrough Advertising by Eugene Schwartz. You can click this link here or go to consulting.com/schwartzbook. This one&#039;s exceptionally good. However, it&#039;s now out of print, which means that it&#039;s no longer being printed. I don&#039;t know why because it&#039;s probably one of the best advertising books ever written on earth, and you can buy it.


You can try Googling it and seeing if you can buy a copy. Only used copies are available, so you can try eBay, you can try Google, you can try all sorts of different things and see if you can get a copy for cheap. You can buy used ones on Amazon here starting at $189. I can tell you, even at 200 bucks, this book is well worth it. This book is worth thousands of dollars because it will teach you how to make a lot more than that, so don&#039;t treat this as a normal book when you look at it and see that it costs a lot of money. If you are serious about getting good at direct response, you want to read it. So that is a whole bunch of resources I&#039;ve given you here. I&#039;ve given you swipefiles, my own stuff, I&#039;ve given you a thousand headlines and a whole bunch of ads, and I&#039;ve given you three resources as well.


So with this information here, it should be enough for you to really grasp the basic concepts of direct response and be able to create some awesome ads. So now that you have a solid understanding of direct response and what makes a good ad, it&#039;s time to create your ad angles. So Crafting Five Ad Angles With Four Images Each. This is the step where we actually start writing your ads. All of the stuff up unto here has been preparation, and education, and telling you how it works, getting your research and all that, but like I said, 95% of the results you get come from preparation, not from the actual doing of it. It&#039;s like athletes always say ... Like Usain Bolt, the world record holder for sprinting, he always says that, &quot;The race is won before ... &quot; he steps on the track.


The race is always won in preparation and training. When you step onto the track, you&#039;re just claiming the prize. Whoever did the most preparation and training wins. No miracles of heaven. It&#039;s always the guy who has just trained the most, and the same is true with Facebook ads. It is not about who&#039;s better at clicking buttons in the Facebook platform. It&#039;s not about who&#039;s using video ads and who&#039;s using chat bots and who&#039;s using all this crap that everyone talks about. Those are distractions. The people who clean up on Facebook ads, are the people who are doing all the preparation off of the Facebook ads platform.


I know it&#039;s a counterintuitive way of thinking, but that&#039;s how it works. If you have a good proof of concept, if you understand direct response and you do good research, and if you go back and look through your calls and everything, you will clean up on Facebook, because it&#039;s only 5% using the platform, 95% preparation. So let&#039;s craft these angles. As you&#039;ve probably noticed, most of the work for a successful Facebook advertising campaign happens outside of Facebook. It&#039;s 95% preparation, 5% application. But now that you have extracted the fractal patterns from your proof of concept, and you understand the golden mean and have a basic understanding of direct response, we&#039;re ready to start creating these things. So let&#039;s do it.


Step one is: Crafting Five Ad Angles. So step one is really writing the copy, step two is finding the images to go together with the copy, so let&#039;s start here with step one. So here&#039;s our workflow. Number one is to brainstorm 5 to 10 possible angles for your ads. You want to use the resources provided to help you come up with these ideas. We&#039;ve got the Ogilvy ads swipe, we&#039;ve got my five $1 million Facebook ad swipe, you&#039;ve got the 1,000 winning headline swipe, and you&#039;ve got the Facebook ads collections swipe. I&#039;ve given you an absolute sea of things, so you should be able to brainstorm 5 to 10 possible angles for your ads. You also want to look at all of those worksheets I got you to pull up in the end of the previous section of this module, where we were looking at your strategy session call recordings and we extracted the fractal pattern from your proof of concept.


So if you have all of that information, you should have absolutely no problem brainstorming 5 to 10 possible angles for your ads. Now, here&#039;s some ideas for your and angles. One is a big promise. So a big promise could be something like, How to Become Porn-Free, if someone was addicted to porn, or How To Lose 42 Pounds In 6 Weeks, or How To Get The Girl Of Your Dreams, or How To ...  It&#039;s basically how to get to the desired situation. That&#039;s why we look at the current situation, the desired situation. The big promise is how to get the desired situation. You could have a big promise with a specific claim, so that would be like, How To Get The Girl Of Your Dreams In 4 Days Or less. It&#039;s a big promise with specificity, so I put the days in here. Or How To Lose 42 Pounds In 2 Weeks.


I&#039;m giving a number of weight to lose and a number of days, so there&#039;s a specific claim in there. Then you could have a first-person story of transformation, so that was the ad that I showed you before, the 26-year-old Punk ad, so if I go here, to this 26-year-old Punk one, Facebook ad number three, this is a personal transformation story told in the first person. So I&#039;m saying, &quot;Four years ago today I was dead broke, living and working out of my parents garage in New Zealand trying to start my own consulting business. I cold-called, door-knocked ... &quot; da da da da da, so this is a story in the first person and I&#039;m talking about a transformation from the current situation to the desired situation. Right? You get it. Another one is removal of pain. So, How To ...  get rid of this, or How To Get Rid Of ... whatever this person&#039;s got that they don&#039;t like.


How To Get Out Of This Lawsuit. Someone&#039;s involved in a lawsuit, like how to get out of this. Or How To Deal With Troubled Children, or something like that. How to solve the pain that they have? And then another one is you could have an actual client testimonial or a case study. Now, these are awesome ads to run if you have them. If you don&#039;t have them, it&#039;s fine. Doesn&#039;t matter. I&#039;ve still made millions of dollars on Facebook without using testimonial ads. So brainstorm 5 to 10 possible angles right now. Pause the video. Get it done. Once you have a name for your ad angle, you want to put it into our FB audiences, angles, and images worksheet. This is available for download in the resources section. You want to keep at it until you come up with 5 to 10 possible angles.


So I&#039;ll show you what this worksheet looks like, available for download beneath the video; FB audiences, angles, and images. You can pull this one up here. It&#039;s an Excel file, but you can click this link here and open it up in Google Docs. I always recommend using Google Docs, and you&#039;ll notice it&#039;s called FB audiences, angles, and images and these multiple tabs. There&#039;s the audiences tab and then some angles tabs. So we&#039;re not creating audiences right now, we&#039;re creating angles so you want to click on angles, then in brackets, ideas. So how this works is you&#039;re putting in your angles here, because they&#039;re ideas at the moment, then once we&#039;ve created your different angles and we&#039;re ready to go and test, when we&#039;re testing, we will move these into the testing tab.


And then when we&#039;re testing them, we&#039;re going to see if they work or not. We&#039;re going to see if the angles work or not, whether they resonate with our niche or not. If they do, then we put them into the proven tab here so that we know what works if we want to refer back to it later. If they don&#039;t work, we put them in the failed tab here. It&#039;s important to keep track of what&#039;s worked, what hasn&#039;t, because we don&#039;t want to come back over old ground. If we tried an angle and it doesn&#039;t work, the last thing we want to do is come back later and try it again if we&#039;ve already done it. And believe me, that stuff happens all the time, so it&#039;s good to keep track of the stuff. It&#039;s always good to come up with ideas. If you have an idea just randomly one day, add it to this list.


Even if you don&#039;t need to launch any new ads, just keep working on this, because you&#039;re going to build up a list of different ideas and then whenever you need to launch new ads, you&#039;ve got just a wealth of information here, and it&#039;s not much of a job to do. You just come in here, you go, &quot;All right. We&#039;ll use this one,&quot; and you can launch it. Simple. So the step in this exercise, says to write down the names of your angles in this spreadsheet. You want to keep at it until you come up with 5 to 10 possible angles, so you only really need to come up with the name of it. So you could say, How To Lose 42 Pounds In 6 Weeks While Doing Nothing. This is just a funny sort of example.


Obviously, this is just a demo, but you want to write down the names of your five angles first. Once you&#039;ve got that done, awesome. Now you&#039;re ready to create the body copy here. In the beginning, we were just brainstorming general ideas. It&#039;s good to come up with 5 to 10, and then just choose the best five. Then we can forget about the other five. We might think about them later, but we only need five. Once you&#039;ve got the general angle sorted out, then we write the copy which is the next step. So once you&#039;ve come up with 5 to 10 ad angles, it&#039;s time to write the body copy for them. So to do this, we open up a blank Google Doc and we just start typing the body copy for your ads there. So we&#039;re not touching Facebook. You&#039;ll notice we&#039;re actually writing our ads off of Facebook.


This is crucially important. When you&#039;re using Facebook, it&#039;s distracting. You&#039;re thinking, &quot;Oh, does this fit here?&quot; Or &quot;Maybe this paragraph&#039;s too long,&quot; or &quot;Maybe this piece of text doesn&#039;t look right here,&quot; because you&#039;re looking at it visually. That&#039;s a bad way to create advertising. You first of all just want to treat it as words and then copy/paste it over to the advertising platform. Otherwise, you have some biases present in your brain, they&#039;re going to subtly wreak havoc with your ads, and it&#039;s going to make your ads worse. So always write ads with Google Docs first, and only later do we launch them into Facebook. That&#039;s it. That&#039;s a trick and a tactic from the pros of the pros.


That&#039;s how all of the top people write ads. So just open up a blank Google Doc, type &quot;headline,&quot; and then write the headline. Then type &quot;body copy&quot; and write the body copy, just like I&#039;ve done in this Five $1 Million Ads file here. You see? I just wrote &quot;headline,&quot; type the headline, &quot;body copy,&quot; started typing the copy. I wrote it all out like this, like I was writing a little essay or a blog post or an article or something. I wrote it like this before I touched Facebook, every single time. That&#039;s one of the secrets to it. So you want to go and do that. Once you have done that, then, when you&#039;re doing it, you want to keep at it and might take you some time.


Just to bring some perspective to this stuff, this will really help a lot if you understand this, but when I wrote these ads here, these ones that made me more than a million dollars each, this 26-year-old Punk ad, it took me six hours to write it. One ad. Six hours. Not joking. To create all five of these ads, I&#039;m pretty sure it took me about 17, 18 hours. I made them all in one day but it took me the entire day and I was focused like crazy, just creating these ads. Because most people, they kind of rush through ads and they think it&#039;s more of the technology and all these other gimmicks. All the power is in the words.


People try video ads, people try all of these different fancy things like carousel ads and Instagram ads, and all of this crap. They&#039;re all about the gimmicks and they write a lousy ad. Honestly, the gimmicks make little to no difference. It doesn&#039;t matter if it&#039;s video or image. All of the power is in the words, and if you don&#039;t believe me just look at my numbers. I have never seen anyone run even a video ad to 10% of the amount that I&#039;ve made on Facebook, so it&#039;s all in the written words. Take your time to write some really killer ads. It will be worth its weight in gold. Someone might say, &quot;Dude, why did you spend 17 hours creating five ads?&quot; Well I could say, &quot;Dude, those five ads made me like nine million bucks, and it was well worth it.&quot; &quot;Would you spend 17 hours to make nine million?&quot; &quot;Yes.&quot;


I&#039;m not saying yours will but every piece of effort you put into this, you will get a proportionate output from it. That&#039;s the way it works. So take your time to really craft some awesome ads and take everything into account, and keep at it until they&#039;re done and you want to refer to the swipefiles I got you to pull out earlier in this module, the extracting fractal patterns worksheet. That is where you will pull all of your gold from. So this worksheet here, where I got you to go through and answer all these questions, all of the gold that you&#039;re going to use in your ads is going to come from out of this, because a fractal tells a story of the process that created it. If we have success in our proof of concept, then what we see here is the process that created that success, and all we&#039;re trying to do is replicate that process and these different pieces into our Facebook ads.


We&#039;re trying to take these little pieces from here and apply them over here, and that&#039;s what really, really smart marketers and copywriters do. They&#039;re constantly looking to do that. Once you have typed up all five ad angles inside Google Docs, you should have the headlines and all of the ad angles fully written, you should be happy with them and everything. Then you want to copy paste the body copy and headlines for all five ad angles from Google Docs into your Facebook, audiences, angles, and images worksheet and you should have all five ad angles with body copy and headlines in that worksheet. I&#039;ll show you what I mean by this. So I&#039;ll open up my ... This is our FB, audiences, angles, and images worksheet and here let&#039;s say these are the ads that I just wrote, so I could copy paste this headline here from Google Docs, and I can just plug it right into here.


So I just go, &quot;Apple V&quot; or &quot;ctrl V&quot; ... paste it right in there. I can&#039;t do right now because I&#039;m not signed in, and it will paste your headline into this here. You want to copy paste all of your headlines, then you want to copy paste all of your body copy which is all of this text here. You want to grab it all and then paste it into the body copy section here. Then description, don&#039;t worry about this yet. I&#039;m going to explain this later so you can leave this blank. And then image, you can leave this blank too, because I&#039;m going to explain this in just a second. The reason why we keep it here, is because we always need to keep track of what we&#039;re doing. The last thing we want to do is make a mess and not know what we&#039;re doing or what works, what doesn&#039;t work.


We don&#039;t want to lose track of cause and effect, because that&#039;s when we just everything up. So it&#039;s important to know what our ideas are, what things we&#039;re testing, what things are proven and what things have failed. Right now, because we&#039;re forming a ad hypothesis, we&#039;re just creating five angles and these are our ideas. So paste them all in here. Once you&#039;ve done that, awesome, you can move on to the next step. So step two is finding four images for each angle. So, number one, look at your five ad angles and think about what images would work with them. So what you want to do, is you just want to look at your ad angles in the audiences, angles, and images worksheet here, you just want to look at them and just start thinking.


Just start daydreaming about what images we think would work well with these, and to really help you with this, to help you come up with image ideas, I provided you with the following resources. So I&#039;ve given you the Five $1 million FB Ads swipefile, which is here, and here you can see the different images I used for each one. Now it&#039;s important to show you how these images relate to the ad. Now it&#039;s important that the image has some sort of relation to the ad. We don&#039;t want the image to be totally abstract because people would be like, &quot;What is this?&quot; so I&#039;ll give you some tips. Whenever you can, which you should do it every single time, use images of you. People are on Facebook and they expect to see people, humans, interacting with things.


So have a photo of you, and sometimes when it looks like you&#039;re in the middle of saying something or expressing something or your hands are moving, it works well. Also, when the image of you here kind of matches the image of you here, it works well too. It&#039;s just consistency. People say, &quot;Oh, this guy&#039;s name is Sam Ovens, here&#039;s a picture of him. There is still a picture of him, probably looks good.&quot; When this isn&#039;t a picture of you, and this isn&#039;t a picture of you, then there&#039;s trouble because it looked suspicious. In this story I talk about moving to New York and making a lot of money. Now here I am, sitting in a nice-looking apartment that looks expensive, and it looks like New York too. So you can see how the image is related to the ad itself but it&#039;s subtle. This is the key to advertising. Make it subtle.


There&#039;s dudes that just stand straight up in front of like a Lamborghini, there&#039;s dudes that go over but they sit in the Lamborghini, and then they get the photos. That not subtle and people just look at that stuff and it&#039;s like cringe-worthy, because anyone can sit in a Lamborghini and get a photo. Most of the time it wouldn&#039;t even be yours. You can lease one. Any poor idiot can lease a Lamborghini, so it doesn&#039;t even say anything. You want to really make things subtle. If you&#039;re going to try and you portray anything, make it really subtle and don&#039;t say it, because people will find it themselves. Then here&#039;s another one which is 9 Millionaire Consultants Were Created With This Advice. This one here, it looks like I&#039;m teaching something, and it&#039;s just an interesting background.


So again, there&#039;s an image of a human. Images of humans always work well, especially when they&#039;re you, and interesting backgrounds. Clear photos, this stuff always works well. Here, there&#039;s me in Manhattan, and you can see Manhattan, and it says, &quot;How A 26-year-old Punk Started A Consulting Business In His Parents&#039; Garage, Moved To Manhattan, And Made $10 million in 4 Years.&quot; Well, you can kind of see how this works. This person is that person, lines up, this looks like Manhattan in the background. This looks expensive so this is an interesting combination and this is why this ad works so well. So you can see how there&#039;s reasons between the ad and the image. Here it says, How Did These Nine Entrepreneurs Make Seven Figures And Get On This Private Jet?


Well here&#039;s a bunch of entrepreneurs. Here&#039;s a private jet. Right? So you get my point. These things kind of relate to each other. I just didn&#039;t find some random image on Google and just throw it in here. When you do that, you weaken your ad. The stronger it ties together, the more powerful your ad will be. It&#039;s just like the lump email with strategy which I taught you in week four or ... yeah, I&#039;m pretty sure it was week four, and in the lump email strategy, we send a lumpy item with the letter and so we might say, &quot;Josh, if you keep spending money on yellow pages ads, it&#039;s pretty much going to go in the bin,&quot; or something like that. Because the headline says that, then we include a trashcan in the letter itself. So the actual lumpy item is related to the headline of the ad and the later, so it ties together.


You should try to do the same thing when it comes to your Facebook ads. Tie the image to the ad. When you do that, it will work a lot better, and you&#039;ll notice all of my images are of people, and they always include me. This works really well. You should always have you in it and when possible, you should try and have other people in it too. Here&#039;s another one. It&#039;s just another one of me. So there&#039;s some examples of some ads and some images. I&#039;ve given you the Facebook swipe folder as well and you can view this here. You can look at all sorts of different ads. Again, you can notice that quite a lot of it, well pretty much all the time, there&#039;s a person in it. The reason why people put people in these ads is because it works. But what you don&#039;t want to do, is this sort of stuff.


Don&#039;t ever ... I took some screenshots of stuff in here too just because it was bad. Don&#039;t ever use a stock photo. That&#039;s just a recipe for disaster. Don&#039;t ever put crap like this on top of the photo, like this sort of widget thing on here, this red thing. Never put images or buttons or textile overlays on top of the image. Just leave it as an image like these ones I&#039;ve done here. If I open up this again ... See this? It&#039;s just an image. I haven&#039;t adjusted it in any way, shape, or form. No border, no widget on it, no text on it, no buttons on it. Nothing. Every single time. This works because it looks like an article, it looks like a news piece, or it looks like something that someone shared genuinely on Facebook. So this is really stealth advertising, because we want to design advertising that doesn&#039;t look like advertising.


We want to design it, it&#039;s like a Trojan horse. So here, this doesn&#039;t really look like an ad. It looks like a story, and it looks like an article in a news piece or something. So it&#039;s really good because it gets people to start reading it, and a lot of the time they don&#039;t even know that they&#039;re reading an ad, but that&#039;s when an ad is good. When an ad can camouflage itself as news, or just a genuine story, then it&#039;s a good ad. It should never look like an ad. This thing here, looks like an ad, so those are some tips. Even stuff like this, there&#039;s some text on here, don&#039;t do that. It ruins it, because this, again, looks like an ad. So don&#039;t do it, just have images of you. And it&#039;s best really not to pose for these. See how this lady is posing for this ad and it looks kind of cheesy? That smells like an ad.


A news piece wouldn&#039;t look like that, neither would a post someone would do on Facebook themselves, and this is the real trick. It shouldn&#039;t look like advertising. This looks like advertising. Even if we remove this text it still looks like advertising because people just don&#039;t make poses like this. What is she doing? This sort of stuff doesn&#039;t really go down well. It still works but it really ruins people&#039;s results. So what you want to do is have natural-looking things, like this is just a natural sort of a position; I&#039;m not really posing or anything. And this is kind of a natural photo. We took this photo not knowing that we were going to use it for an ad, so it really was just a natural photo that we took. Same with all of my images. They&#039;re really just natural photos and I&#039;m not really posing.


See here I&#039;m not even looking at it, I was actually teaching people, and you can see here this was a video that I created and I just grabbed a screenshot of one of the parts of the video. That&#039;s why I&#039;m in the middle of saying something, so that&#039;s why that looks good there as an ad because it&#039;s not a pose that&#039;s kind of forced, it was happening naturally. This is how you create good ads. Don&#039;t ever pose for images and then use those, because people can tell. People have a sixth sense for this sort of stuff, and when they can smell that it&#039;s an advertising image or a pose or something like that, then they&#039;re not going to really read it. Now let me get back to our presentation.


So here&#039;s some image tips. Use high-quality images of you, really high-quality. Don&#039;t use pixelated images. Has to be really nice high-resolution. People love those things. The last thing we want our ad to look like is an ad, and this might sound counterintuitive, but this is how all good stuff is; counterintuitive. So we don&#039;t want our ad to look like an ad. It should look like a post done by a friend, because that&#039;s what Facebook is for. When people are scrolling down their Facebook news feed, they&#039;re not looking for ads, they&#039;re trying to avoid ads. What they&#039;re looking for is interesting posts from people. They&#039;re looking for human interactions and stories and stuff like that, so your ad should actually be camouflaged as one of those.


It should be a post and it should have ... Now who ever does a post on their newsfeed to their friends and puts like buttons and text and does weird poses in it? Their friends would be like, &quot;Dude, what is that?&quot; And they&#039;ll probably laugh at them. So don&#039;t do that in your ads. This is the secret. Don&#039;t treat these things differently. Don&#039;t treat an ad any different to how you would talk to a normal person, or how you would do a normal post to your friends or your family. Treat it the same and it would be a stealth ad that really just camouflages itself, and those ones work the best. Those ones are dangerous. Don&#039;t modify your images by putting text, borders, buttons, etc. on them and make them natural, impersonal and include you, or you with other people.


I really want to make a point of this. The image should be of you. I&#039;ll say it again. The image should be of you. It will work quite better if it is. People want to see you. They want to know who&#039;s talking. If you don&#039;t want to use images of you, which is not recommended, you can use Google image search to look for relevant images that match your ad angle, and you want to avoid using stock photos in lame-looking, fake corporate images. No, don&#039;t use stock photos. Don&#039;t use those lame-looking things that I showed you before. People really despise those things. Who wants to look at those things? So we need four images for all five ad angles, and you can have some overlap, but only if the images are still relevant to the ad angle.


So, for example, if we have five angles and then we&#039;ve got four images each, well that&#039;s 20 images, so it&#039;s quite hard to find 20 different images. So what we do instead, is we can sometimes get away with way less than 20. We might be able to get away with 10 and then we can sort of recycle some images and use them in multiple different angles. But the key is that they have to still be relevant. They have to still work for that message. There can&#039;t be a disconnect. So really you need at least 10 images, 10 to 15, and then if you have those, then you should be able to spread them across all five ad angles. You want to keep at it until you get these images. You can ask your friend to take a photo of you, and you can do a little photo shoot for free using your iPhone or your friend&#039;s iPhone.


Phone cameras these days are high enough quality to take these images. You don&#039;t need to hire a photographer, you don&#039;t need to do anything fancy, you can just get your friend or your family or your spouse, whatever to take photos of you, or you can look in your Facebook profile or your Instagram profile and find photos of you there. Or you can look in any videos you&#039;ve got. If you&#039;ve got any videos, you can look through those and you can pause the video at different points and take screenshots of the video. There&#039;s lots of different ways to get images but you need to keep at this, keep at step number five until you&#039;ve got them all. Once you&#039;ve found all of your ad images, you want to upload them to Google Drive and then sort them into folders labeled with the name of each ad angle.


Then, you want to share the link for the different folders in the Facebook, audience, angle, and image worksheet. So, if we go back here, I have also included another file for you here, available in the resources section for download and it&#039;s called Proven Facebook Ad Images. Here, I provide a PDF swipefile of the images that I&#039;ve used in my ads that have been successful. So the top one has worked the best, the second one has worked the second best. As you can see, these are just candid, normal poses. I actually wasn&#039;t even posing. Well, this one I was, but I was just trying to look normal, and this one someone took of me when I was actually in the middle of a conversation.


I didn&#039;t even really know there was a photo being taken. So these sorts of photos always work the best because they look natural and they don&#039;t even really look natural, they truly are natural. That&#039;s how they work well. You can see both really clear, both high-resolution, both of a person, you can see their face. This one worked really well. It&#039;s me teaching people. This one worked really well, this one teaching again, this one worked pretty well, this one here you can say it&#039;s just a slight variation, this one I&#039;m looking that way, this one I&#039;m looking this way, another jet one, another one of me working, this one ... And you know what? This one actually didn&#039;t work that well.


I included it in here just to show you. Because this is really professional and it looks corporate-ey, it actually works nowhere near as well as just one like this. It still works, but nothing compared to this. So don&#039;t think you have to have these corporate-looking things because they work worse. This one was a way more polished version of the other ones and it worked worse. This one worked pretty good. This one worked pretty good just &#039;cause it looks kind of strange, &#039;cause we used a HDR filter for this thing. We were just experimenting with different stuff, but my best ones are at the top. These top three and four, really good images. As you can see, none of them have any fancy text or widgets on them. They&#039;re all just photos of me doing different things.


So that swipefile should help you with your image selection as well. Then what you want to do when you&#039;ve got all of your images, upload them all to Google Drive, and why we do that is we want to keep them stored somewhere. We want to have them stored in a safe place that we can refer back to them later on, and also so we can launch them when we launch our Facebook ads very soon. So once you&#039;ve uploaded them to Drive, you can right-click on the files, right-click and select &quot;share link&quot; and then you want to copy paste that link in here next to each one of the ad angles. So you got your headline, the body copy, the description should still be left blank, and then you put in it the Google Doc link here for the images. That way, when we come back and refer back to this we just click on the link and it ... boom, it opens up the images.


This, believe me, later on down the track when we&#039;ve tested different things and there&#039;s a lot of information in here, you will be so glad that you organized things this way and structured things this way. Mark my word for it. You will be so happy that you did this. Don&#039;t be one of those people that just makes an absolute mess when they first start, because if you&#039;ve got a messy set-up when you start, my God is it going to be messy when we start scaling. It&#039;s going to be so messy that you won&#039;t be able to scale. So messy in fact, it probably will fail. You&#039;ve got to keep things clean so you know what you&#039;re doing.


Once you&#039;ve done that, awesome. You have found all of your images for all of your angles. So congratulations. You have now created your ad hypothesis and you have it ready for live market testing. So this was a long video, we had a lot of ground to cover as you can see, but creating ads is a big deal. They can make a lot of money, they can take a business from just a one-person sort of thing, that was your one person just making five grand a month, and it can really scale it up to a multiple million-dollar-per-month thing. Like one of my students, Andrew [Argu 02:17:02], he started with me last year in january when he was making 17 grand a month, and right now with this training that I&#039;ve taken him through on ads and everything, he&#039;s now at $900,000 a month, that&#039;s almost a million. And it&#039;s because of ads, and it&#039;s because I really taught him how to create killer ads. So this time around, I didn&#039;t want to skimp on this ads training.


I wanted to go all out and take you through everything there is to know to create some dangerous Facebook ads. If you do this correctly, if you follow all of these processes, you will have some ads that will just decimate your competition. You&#039;re going to be running laps around everyone. So take the time to do it, work thoroughly step-by-step through the process, and do it properly because you&#039;ll have the money to show for it later on. So that&#039;s it for this module. Thanks for watching. I&#039;ll see you in the next one, right now, which is How To Form Your Audience Hypothesis. That&#039;s where we&#039;re going to find the 30 different audiences that you&#039;re going to launch these ads to, when we go to launch, which is going to happen in the next module after that. So we&#039;re getting really close right now, we&#039;re almost there, we&#039;re almost live, and I&#039;ll see you in the next video right now. Thanks for watching.
