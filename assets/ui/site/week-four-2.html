                        Hey everyone, Sam Ovens here and welcome to the second training module in week four called the Alchemy of Client Attraction. In this training module here, I&#039;m going to show you how we attract total strangers from within our niche or our market and how we attract them to us and get them to fill out an application so that we can have a call with them and then use our sales script and convert them into a paying customer of ours.


Last week in week three, I showed you the alchemy of client conversion and that is how we convert someone on a sales call from an interested prospect into a paying customer, but in order to get somebody on to a phone call and convert them, we first of all have to get their attention and we have to attract them to us and then the second step is to convert them.


In this training module today, we&#039;re going to discuss the art and the science behind attracting clients to our business and also, how to find the ones who are most interested and filter them and separate them from the ones who are just going to waste our time and the tire kickers who are never going to buy anyway because that is one of the most important things when it comes to marketing and getting clients.


Here&#039;s what we&#039;re going to cover today. We&#039;re going to start off with what the alchemy of client attraction is and why it&#039;s important and then I&#039;m going to show you the big myth and common mistake that people make when it comes to attracting clients. There&#039;s a big myth which a lot of people believe and I still see most consultants and most business owners falling for this one every single day. I see it all the time.


I&#039;m going to explain what that is and how you can avoid it and how you can solve it and then I&#039;m going to show you the science behind attracting potential clients to your business. I&#039;m going to show you all of the mechanics and the processes behind this so that you can get a fundamental understanding of how it all works.


It&#039;s one thing to just show you what to do, but it&#039;s another thing for you to thoroughly understand why it works because if I just show you what to do when you go out and do it and then if it doesn&#039;t work or you&#039;re stumped, but if I show you ... if I get you to understand fundamentally how these things work, then if you go out and try it and it doesn&#039;t work, then you know what to change and there&#039;s a massive gap and knowledge between people who just know what to do and people who understand how it works.


I&#039;m going to show you the science behind everything so that you can get a really thorough understanding of it. Then I&#039;m going to show you how we use natural selection to find the right clients and attract them to us. In any market, only 3% of that market is ready to buy from you now. It doesn&#039;t matter what niche or what market you&#039;re in, at any given moment in time, only 3% of that market is really looking to change and looking to evolve.


Most people go out and they just target everyone. They&#039;re like, &quot;I&#039;m going to just target everyone in my niche.&quot; But, that&#039;s not the right way to go. You should learn how to separate the 3% who are ready to go and pretty much just forget about the other 97% and just put all of your focus and attention on to that magic 3% and I&#039;m going to show you exactly how we do that using natural selection.


Then I&#039;m going to introduce you to the two types of client attraction which we have. Organic attraction methods and paid attraction methods. These other specific ... the specific tactical things which we use to attract clients into our consulting business and organic ... what organic means is basically free, easy to use and fast to deploy methods and obviously paid ones which means they cost money, but they&#039;re very scalable and they&#039;re very automated.


Organic is awesome for getting started, getting your first few clients and establishing your proof of concept and then paid is ideal for once you already have that proof of consent formed, paid is ideal for really scaling your business up and taking it to big levels. First of all, I want to show you our client acquisition methodology.


This is our process from start to finish and we start off with two types of client attraction methods at the front of the funnel and one is paid methods which I just explained and organic methods. Then, that&#039;s how we get our message in front of our niche or our market and we created our message in week one that was your message hypothesis worksheet, we talked all about resonating your message.


We already have your message together and now what we need is we need a vehicle to get that message in front of your market and that&#039;s what these different methods are. You can either use paid vehicles to get that message in front or you can use organic free methods to get that message in front of your niche.


That&#039;s how we really generate the interest and get in front of people and then what we do is we take them through this process here where we show them a value video and then they watch that video, they see what that&#039;s all about and everything and then some people fill out a survey and then some people get on a call with us.


What happens is as we show people our ads, we get in front of people with organic methods and not everyone who sees these methods takes action obviously. Most people who see advertisements don&#039;t do anything about them and a lot of people think that means that the ad didn&#039;t work but it couldn&#039;t be further from the truth.


Ads are only really designed to get the attention of a select few people and then as long as it&#039;s getting the attention of those people, then they should take action and watch the value video and then, after watching the value video, complete the survey and then after that, jump on a call with you and then when you&#039;re on the call with people, you&#039;re using alchemic conversion script and you&#039;re converting them into a paying customer.


This is our client acquisition methodology from a bird&#039;s eye view. It&#039;s like the 30,000 foot view. What we&#039;re going to be discussing today in this training module is the paid attraction methods, I&#039;m going to explain those to you and I&#039;m going to tell you what they all are and then I&#039;m also going to explain our organic methods to you and introduce you to each one.


We have got five of them. I&#039;m going to tell you the used case and the application for both paid and organic and when you should use organic, when you should use paid, the pros and cons for each one, all of that stuff. We&#039;ve got a lot of awesome information to share with you in this video. I can&#039;t wait to get it all across.


Now let&#039;s discuss the big myth and common mistake that people make when it comes to attracting clients and this one is big. It&#039;s widespread and I see it everywhere. Not only with consultants but in every other niche, pretty much everyone falls for this one. Most people look at their market or their niche and they see this.


They see a bunch of people and they think they&#039;re all the same. They&#039;re like, &quot;Oh, all of those people are in my market.&quot; I hear it all the time, people are like, &quot;Oh, my market is this group. All of these people in this Facebook group, that&#039;s my market.&quot; They think everyone in that group is their market and they think everyone in that group should buy that thing.


They just look at a whole group of people and they see them just like this. They see them as uniform individuals that are all the same and all have equal probability of purchasing and using your consulting services. I&#039;ve written here most people view their niche or market as a huge collection of people and they believe that they are all the same and all deserve the same amount of effort and attention when it comes to marketing and selling to them.


What I see most businesses do is they just get on the phone and they start cold calling. They get the phone book and they&#039;re like, &quot;Okay, these are all the businesses that are in the plumbing niche so I&#039;m just going to call them all up and talk to them all.&quot; or &quot;These are all of the businesses that are in the dry cleaning niche, I&#039;m just going to call them all up and talk to them all.&quot;


They approach every single person within a niche using the exact same method and they say the same thing and they give everyone equal effort and attention as if they all have the same likelihood of buying from the consultant or the business owner. That couldn&#039;t be further from the truth. They then proceed to market to all people with equal efforts and work their way through everyone.


This is how people attract clients. Most people market to everybody in their niche and they give equal effort and attention to every person and this takes a huge amount of energy, resources and time. I see the companies that have to just dial for dollars and use yellow pages and just call everyone, they have call centers of hundreds of people that are just making back-to-back calls.


The reason why they need to have such a massive workforce and the reason why they need to call so many people is because most people say no to them. These companies that get less than a 1% conversion rate. They&#039;ve got to make a hundred calls just to even get an appointment. Some of them are a lot worse. These companies, all they do is they use brute force to try and just contact everyone and this is really the mistake that people make.


Ultimately, this is a huge waste because most people don&#039;t buy yet. The entrepreneur spent equal time attempting to attract every person regardless of whether they purchased. At the end of the day, when everything is done and settled and let&#039;s just say that a business called every single person in their niche or their market, let&#039;s say they called a thousand people and then let&#039;s say out of a thousand people, 20 purchased.


The problem is is that that business who got the clients, they spent an hour for example talking to a thousand different businesses when only 20 of the businesses ended up buying. That&#039;s a huge waste of time. That means that most of their time was actually wasted and only a very small amount of their time actually went towards converting those people who are ready into paying customers. This is a huge inefficiency that I see widespread throughout the consulting industry and also in all other industries.


This is the big myth. Market to everybody in your market equally and with equal effort and attention. Here&#039;s the truth, only 3% of any given market is ready to buy at the current moment in time. For example, if a market had 100 people in it, only three of them would be ready to buy a product or a service that solved their problem or pain at the current moment in time.


This presents us with a big problem. Here&#039;s the big problem with attraction and trying to get clients. Only 3% of any given market is ready to buy right now. How do we know who the 3% are. For example, I don&#039;t know if there&#039;s a hundred people on the screen or not, let&#039;s just assume there is. You see, there&#039;s only three of them which have a green tick on them.


Let&#039;s say this is our niche and let&#039;s say our niche has 100 people in it. Let&#039;s say three of those people within that hundred are ready to buy our consulting services right now and the other 97 are not. Our biggest challenge and the big problem as a consultant and an entrepreneur and somebody who&#039;s trying to attract clients into their business is how to identify who those three people are without having to talk to all 100 of them because if we talk to all 100 of them, sure, we will find the three but it&#039;s extremely inefficient to do that.


How do you find a needle in a haystack without manually inspecting every single stack of hay? How do we find three people in a crowd of 100 without personally speaking to all of them. Most people just brute force it and speak to all 100 people manually to find the three who are ready to buy now. They say it&#039;s a numbers game.


You hear this all the time from people who make a lot of cold calls. They&#039;re just like it&#039;s a numbers game. You just got to call enough people. There is some truth to that. If you&#039;re just someone who blindly cold calls all day, don&#039;t get me wrong, that is way better than doing nothing. The people or the entrepreneurs and consultants and business who just make cold calls all day long, they still beat the people who do nothing because obviously, the people who do nothing get nothing.


Making cold calls and playing the numbers game is better than that, but there is something which is exponentially better than all of that and it&#039;s not talking to all of these people and it&#039;s not using brute force and it&#039;s not really playing a numbers game. This is not the way to attract clients. There&#039;s a much better way.


Now let&#039;s discuss the science behind attracting potential clients to your consulting business. We call this the alchemy of client attraction. Last week in week three we had the alchemy of client conversion and in this week, this module we&#039;re discussing the alchemy of client attraction. How to attract those people to us and sort that magic 3% that&#039;s really to buy now.


First off, do you remember why people buy consulting services? We discussed this last week in week three. People will have a current situation. This is me, this is my situation, these are my problems and my pains and my issues and these are my desires. Everyone has a current situation and they&#039;ve got some things which they desire and they&#039;ve also got some things which are painful that&#039;s the case for every single person.


Then what we do is we flash a stimulus in front of them which could be an organic attraction method or it could be a paid attraction method and this could be just an ad. It could be a Facebook ad or it could be an email or it could be a message on Facebook, it could be anything like that. This has our marketing message in it. Then what happens is when the person in our niche sees that stimulus, it stimulates them and it agitates them and what it does is a good stimulus and a good marketing message should really evoke some sort of emotion and response inside the individual.


What I mean by that is it should strike a nerve like the the message should really nail what desire they have. It should really pinpoint that thing that they want or it should pinpoint that massive problem which they&#039;ve got which is really driving them crazy. In order to get somebody&#039;s attention, we have to have a message that really resonates with their current situation and their problems and their desires and their fears and things like that.


When we do that correctly, when the stimulus really strikes a nerve with the person, it creates an agitated current situation so they went from just having a normal current situation and now they&#039;ve got an agitated one which is when there&#039;s some sort of gap. They&#039;ve had a desire and it was kind of there, it was below surface level.


Their pain, it hadn&#039;t really broken through and showing like it&#039;s hid yet. The pain and the desire was at bay and now that they&#039;ve seen the stimulus and they have seen at this ad which we&#039;ve put in front of them, now it&#039;s growing that pain and it&#039;s growing that desire and it&#039;s like we really kicked their bruised knee and we we started to really crank up all of the emotion inside of them.


Now they&#039;re in an agitated current situation. When they&#039;re in an agitated current situation, we take them through our funnel process and that&#039;s the value video and then they complete a survey and then they fill out a form for a call and they do this because they want to fix this agitated current situation. They want to solve the problem they have or they want to obtain the desire which they have.


That is the reason why they go out of their way to complete a form because they believe that we understand them and that we might have the solution to help them take away their pain or help them achieve their desire. After they fill out that form, they just return back to their agitated current situation until we do the phone call with them.


Then we get on the phone call with them and we use our alchemic conversion script to take them through the process and we get them to purchase and how that works is the script is designed in a way that crystallizes the current situation. A normal person, a normal participant in any market doesn&#039;t really have a crystallized current situation.


They understand that it&#039;s not really the way they would want it, they want it to be improved and all of this and they&#039;re a little bit unhappy or a little bit uncomfortable with their current situation but they haven&#039;t pinpointed it. They haven&#039;t crystallized it and put a data point next to these things and really defined it and put it on paper.


That&#039;s the first thing we do on that on this using the sales script. We really crystallize that current state and we get data points for everything and we really bring the prospect&#039;s attention to their current situation and then what we do is we start to create separation by defining the desired situation.


We separate this desired situation here and we really stretch it over until there is a clear separation between their current situation and their desired situation. Just like we crystallized their current situation, we got data points for it and we really put it on paper. We do the same for their desired situation. We crystallize that point, we get data points for it, we put it on paper and now we bring a lot of clarity into this person&#039;s world.


They were in an agitated situation, they didn&#039;t know what they should do or they didn&#039;t know what they should change or they might have had some ideas, but they didn&#039;t know which one to act on. Either way, the person was unhappy. The stimulus got them to take some response and then on the call, we crystallized their current state and then separated their desired state and crystallized that and now we&#039;ve really created separation here.


We have defined this gap, something which we call the gap and the gap is the distance between where they are right now and where they want to be. It&#039;s where they are right now, their current situation, their current state and where they want to be in in the future, their desired state and this is the cause of all pain and all discomfort for everyone in the entire world. The reason why the economy, the global economy tics everyday is because people are basically waking up each day and trying to buy a better version of themselves or a desired version of themselves which they believe is right.


What we are doing is we&#039;re bringing clarity to their situation first, we&#039;re diagnosing, we&#039;re creating a defined current situation and then we&#039;re creating a defined desired situation and then what we&#039;re doing is once we&#039;ve created separation there, we are getting the person to admit that they can&#039;t achieve that on their own because if they could achieve it on their own, they would already have achieved it. That&#039;s plain and simple.


We&#039;re getting them to admit that they can&#039;t do it on their own. Now, they&#039;re in a very unique situation where they know where they are now or they know where they want to be, they know that their current situation isn&#039;t ideal, they don&#039;t want to stay there, they know they want to get to their desired situation and they know they can&#039;t get there on their own and now what we do in the conversion script is we position ourselves and our offer, our consulting offer as the vehicle to bridge someone from that current situation to that desired situation.


It&#039;s a beautiful process for converting someone and making a sale on the phone. It is seriously powerful. That&#039;s just a quick recap of how we do that and the science of client conversion is creating separation from the agitated current state to two clearly defined and separated states. Once you have created separation from the agitated state, you must position you and your offer as the vehicle to bridge the gap between the two states.


Truly masterful salesman create separation from an agitated situation to a clearly defined current situation in a clearly defined desired situation. They then position themselves and their offer as the key to that desired situation. To put it simply, truly masterful salesman don&#039;t sell things. They sell futures. When you use this conversion script correctly, you&#039;re really finding out what someone wants in their future and then if you&#039;re able to help them with that with your consulting offer, then we position ourselves as that vehicle and we really ... it&#039;s very powerful because we&#039;re not really selling consulting service.


We&#039;re selling someone access to the future which they want in their life or in their business. That is a quick recap on why people buy consulting services and how we convert strangers into clients, but how do we attract the people we convert on the phone? How do we know who is ready to buy and who is going to waste our time? Last week in week three, we really covered that whole process for how to convert people on the phone, but how do we get people on the phone?


This is a piece which we need. We need a way to generate calls and generate interest from people so that we can get on the phone with them and sell them and use that powerful conversion script. What we use is something called natural selection. This is how we attract clients to us. It says how we use natural selection to find the right clients and attract them to us.


First of all, what is natural selection? Some of you might know, some of you might not, I&#039;ll just cover it briefly so that you understand it because it is ... I don&#039;t think any human should really even be alive without thoroughly understanding this because it&#039;s so powerful and it will completely change your life, it will change your business and everything when you understand it.


Natural selection is a natural process that results in the survival and reproductive success of individuals or groups best adjusted to their environment. This leads to the evolution of genetic qualities be suited to that particular environment. That is the definition of it, I&#039;ll explain it in plain English really soon, but natural selection is simply survival of the fittest.


In nature, it&#039;s like if a species doesn&#039;t adapt or evolve fast enough, it gets wiped out and it becomes extinct and it&#039;s what we call survival of the fittest because only the strongest species and the species who can evolve and change and adapt are able to survive in nature. Here&#039;s an example so that you really thoroughly understand this.


The first thing we see with natural selection is that there is variation and traits between different people, different everything. In the world, every single thing has variation to it. Even different fish have variations, different animals. different plants, different everything, bacteria, everything has variation, different humans have variation.


The first thing we notice is that there is variation in traits and a really simple example was to use these beetles. It says here, for example some beetles are green and some are brown and you can see some green and brown beetles on the screen and then there is differential reproduction. Since the environment can&#039;t support unlimited population growth, not all individuals get to reproduce to their full potential.


An example is green beetles tend to get eaten by birds and survive to reproduce less often than brown beetles do. Let&#039;s say in the environment which these beetles live, there is this bird that hangs around and its eyes can see the green beetles better than it can see the brown ones. It pretty much can&#039;t see the brown ones. That means that the bird just keeps catching the green ones and they keep dying, but the brown ones, they get away and what happens is over enough time, the green ones start to get wiped out and they&#039;re not reproducing as much, but the brown ones aren&#039;t getting wiped out so they can reproduce more.


Then there is hereditary and the surviving brown beetles have brown baby beetles because this trait has a genetic basis. We see this happen in nature all the time. If some gene or some genetic mutation isn&#039;t really desirable in nature, for example being a green beetle, if that doesn&#039;t really serve the species, then what will happen is it will start to die out and most beetles will start to become brown beetles.


Then the end result is that the more advantageous traits, the brown coloration which allows the beetles to have more offspring becomes more common in the population and if this process continues, eventually all individuals in the population will be brown and that&#039;s what happens. We started off with some variation where there was brown and green and then through natural selection, we end up with just brown and this is natural selection and most people are aware of natural selection in nature, but they are not aware of natural selection and business.


I just gave you an example from nature and you might have been like, &quot;Why are we looking at examples of beetles and birds and things when this is a program about consulting?&quot; I first explained it in nature so I could then show you an example in business and it will make a lot more sense that way. Here is an example of natural selection in business. We see variation and traits and this example says some businesses are technology and internet savvy while others reject technology. There&#039;s two types of businesses here.


There&#039;s one which is represented with an abacus on the screen and the other which is represented with a computer. We&#039;ve got equal amounts of these. We&#039;ve got half the population is tech savvy businesses, the other half of the population is non tech savvy businesses. There&#039;s variation and traits. This happened recently. This happened in the last ten years and it&#039;s still happening today all over the place.


This one should really resonate with people and a lot of people should understand this one because it&#039;s happening right now and then number two is there is differential reproduction. Since the business environment which is the market or the niche can&#039;t support unlimited business growth for all businesses that doesn&#039;t work, not all businesses make money to their full potential.


An example is that tech rejecting businesses can&#039;t serve customers as well as tech-embracing businesses. The customers choose to buy from the tech savvy businesses and the other non-tech savvy businesses start to die out. Just like in nature how we had the bird which preferred to eat the green beetles. In this situation, we have got customers who prefer a different type of business. When a customer prefers a different type of business and when a business has an advantage over other businesses, what will start to happen is that the businesses with the disadvantage will start to die out and they will start to disappear.


Then there is heredity. The surviving tech savvy businesses reproduce more profits, they reproduce more staff and more customers with the tech savvy gene. If all businesses are moving into this tech savvy, genetic mutation, then people in the university are going to start learning about technology. More technology products are going to be in different houses and everywhere.


More people to become used to using computers which has happened and still happening right now. Then, the end result is the more advantageous trait which is tech savviness which allows the business to produce more profit becomes more common in the population and if this process continues, eventually all businesses in the population will be tech savvy.


Just like the green beetles got wiped out and the brown beetles replace them completely, 100% the old green beetle went extinct. The same thing will happen with non-tech savvy businesses and businesses which reject technology and we&#039;re seeing this happen right now. Here&#039;s a direct comparison. Natural selection in nature and nature different species must adapt to changing environments in order to survive.


This is done by evolving to avoid predators and better suit their habitat. For beetles, they really need to evolve as a species in order to change their color and become brown so that they can avoid the predator which is taking them all out. That is what they need to do in order to survive and then with natural selection and business, different species must adapt to changing environments in order to survive.


This is done by evolving to better serve customers and avoiding the competition as well as better suiting the current habitat. In business, you&#039;ve got to evolve lots of different ways. One is you&#039;ve got to evolve to better serve the customer and their needs and expectations and you&#039;ve also got to evolve so that you can defend yourself against the competition.


You also have to evolve to suit the changing environment in which you&#039;re in which might be the country of laws are changing and all of that stuff or if these different trends which are happening, you have to evolve in those ways in order to survive and with nature, in nature, different species survive through three functions. One is food.


Evolving to be to catch food, they might grow a stronger beak or they might develop camouflage so they can hide from their prey when they trying to eat. They&#039;re evolving in a way so that they can eat and that is one part of their evolution. The other part is safety. They&#039;re evolving to better avoid predators. These beetles, they&#039;re evolving to try and become another color so that they can better hide from this bird which comes in and keeps taking them out.


In their habitat, evolving to better suit, changing habitat conditions. If they&#039;re in a climate which is getting more polluted, they&#039;ve got to evolve in order to be able to withstand that or if they&#039;re in an environment which keeps getting hotter and sunnier, they need to evolve in order to be able to handle that.


In nature, animals and different plants and species and all of that, they have to evolve to really, to survive with these three main functions and in business, different species survive through three functions pretty much the same like nature and one is food and evolving to better serve customers and make money.


In business, the food is money and if you don&#039;t believe me, see how long a business last for without money. Without money, any business will die and it dies fast and it&#039;s pretty much just like not having any food or not having anything to eat. Food for a business is it&#039;s money and it&#039;s cash. In order to make money, the business has to best serve the customer because if the business doesn&#039;t serve the customer well, then they&#039;re not going to be able to get the money from the customer because the customers is going to buy from somebody else.


That&#039;s one way businesses have to evolve. The second one is safety and this is evolving to better avoid competitors. Just like there&#039;s that bird that keeps coming in and taking out the beetles, in business, there&#039;s different competitors who come in and they start swallowing up market share and they start taking out all of these different businesses and a massive one which just ate up a huge part of the market is Amazon.


There were companies who didn&#039;t think Amazon would be a threat to them at all and it just tore them up. Even entire chains and multi-billion dollar companies got torn apart by Amazon and that&#039;s a massive force in a lot of markets. If a business doesn&#039;t evolve to better avoid the competition, it will get taken out and then third is habitat and that&#039;s evolving to better suit changing market conditions.


If customer preferences are moving one way like an example is technology, that&#039;s obviously a trending customer preference so evolving in order to make your business more tech savvy or if the laws are changing or if all of these different things are changing in your competitive environment, you&#039;ve got to be aware of those and evolve your business for that as well.


For beetles at nature, the number one priority is to avoid birds and survive and the species which fails to evolve will die because the bird is going to keep coming in and taking everyone out. In the example of the beetles which I showed you, the number one priority, the number one driving force is to avoid those birds through evolving and changing color.


The number one driving force and the number one priority for businesses is to evolve to better serve the market and in doing so produce more profit. The number one thing a business needs to do is make profit. Without profit and without money, any business will die. It doesn&#039;t matter how nice the people are, it doesn&#039;t matter how smiley there are, it doesn&#039;t matter how awesome their website looks, it doesn&#039;t matter ... nothing matters.


If the business can&#039;t make money, it&#039;s gone. In order to make money, the business has to serve customers and it has to be competitively serving customers so that it can get money because that&#039;s how a business generates money and the species which fails to evolve will die and this is what we call survival of the fittest. In nature and business, the key is always survival. The best way to achieve it is through evolution.


Here&#039;s some examples of extinction and in nature and business. You might be wondering how are these two closely related? They sound completely different. I&#039;ve got some images of some extinct animals here like dinosaurs and mammoths and things, but then on the other side of the screen, I&#039;ve got extinct businesses like big ones, like Borders and Target and Blockbuster.


These things aren&#039;t even very old. I know mammoths and dinosaurs are really old but Borders and Target and Blockbuster, these things are pretty new. They were thriving businesses not that long ago. The same way animal species die out and become extinct, business species die out and become extinct. If businesses fail to adapt to changing market conditions, they will die out and eventually become extinct as new, more evolved species take their place.


It&#039;s quite simple. If were to sum it up in three words, it&#039;s evolve or die and here is a quote from me. It&#039;s a pinup which is available for download below this video in the resources section. This is a powerful thing to understand. It says when the facts change, I change my mind. In nature, life and business, the rules of the game are constantly changing.


What serves you at one stage of development might harm you at others. Facts in life and in business change too. When the facts change. I change my mind. It doesn&#039;t matter how deeply rooted or sacred anything is. When the rules of the game change, I dispose of it and evolve for new conditions and in nature and business, it&#039;s not the strongest of species that survives nor the most intelligent, but rather the one most adaptable to change.


This is something which you can print out and pinup on your wall. This is a powerful thing to understand about natural selection in nature because this goes so many ways. If you don&#039;t evolve your mindset, then your going to have problems and if you don&#039;t evolve your business, then you&#039;re going to have problems and if you don&#039;t evolve yourself like you&#039;re going to have problems and what people don&#039;t understand is they think that if something&#039;s a fact, it&#039;s a fact and it never changes and a fact is just set of ... for all of remaining time, once something&#039;s a fact, it&#039;s a fact.


Once people believe something they think, &quot;That&#039;s it. This is the way it&#039;s done. This is the way it should always be done because this is the way its always been done.&quot; The truth is is that facts change all the time, even the biggest facts in the world change. Most people cling onto those facts and they don&#039;t want to change. They reject change or they even fight change. Often when things are changing, people are putting up a fight and they&#039;re saying like, &quot;We refuse to change all of this.&quot; But what happens, what those people don&#039;t understand is that if they do that, then they going to get wiped out.


Naturally, natural selection is going to cull those people from the population because they are not able to adapt and change. In your life and with your business and everything, you want to be open to change and adaptable to change because that really is one of the secrets in being really successful.


I&#039;ve learned to really be able to evolve and change myself really quick almost immediately. I can be thrown into chaotic circumstances and situations and environments and quickly gather the necessary information and just totally change everything around in a back and that&#039;s probably the most important skill to have of everything and you might be wondering what this has to do with consulting and getting clients like what is this natural selection stuff have to do with that?


This entire program has been designed around the central theme of evolution and it has three main focuses. Number one, is to evolve the way you perceive reality by teaching you my alchemy paradigm and world view. A lot of people have old faulty paradigms. The way they perceive reality, the way they perceive themselves and business and money and all of these things, it&#039;s wrong and it&#039;s faulty.


One of the things which we are doing in this program is evolving your paradigm and bringing that to a more accurate perceiver of how things really are. That&#039;s one thing we&#039;re evolving. Number two, is to evolve your work and income by teaching you my scientific method of consulting. The other thing we&#039;re evolving is your career.


A lot of people come from low income jobs or low income businesses which they own. Some people don&#039;t even ... some people come into this program, they don&#039;t even have a job. Some people don&#039;t have a skill set or a niche or any of the stuff. Some people don&#039;t know anything about business and that&#039;s fine because we evolve their work and income by teaching them the scientific method of consulting.


We get people to evolve themselves, their skills, their understanding of business and everything and by doing that, we&#039;re able to evolve their income. We&#039;re able to take people from low income earners and people in debt and everything into people who make massive incomes and that&#039;s how we&#039;ve created so many millionaire consultants and so many six-figure consultants.


The most success stories in the entire industry by a mile. Then number three is to train you to become a consultant that advances the evolution of participants in your chosen niche or market. What I mean by this is this training program really teaches you how to find a niche and then be a force for change and improvement within that niche in order to evolve people and bring them more up-to-date with their environment and how things are.


The truth is, when the facts change, most people don&#039;t change their minds or their ways and they&#039;re stubborn and reject change, some even fight it. Nature will cull these people and as a consultant, your main role is to find niches or markets where the facts have changed but participants haven&#039;t so that you can be the driving force helping them to evolve. This is a powerful sentence here because in week one, when we&#039;re taking a view on the market and seeing the chart of truth and all of those things which was in the taking a view on the market module in week one.


We&#039;re really looking at different niches and markets and we&#039;re seeing what the status quo is and what most people believe to be true. What we find a lot of the time is that most participants in a niche think that this is the way things should be done and this is the way that they should run their business or this is they should run their personal life or whatever.


It doesn&#039;t have to be business or financial. It could be any form of consulting or coaching. People believe these things are the facts, but in reality, the facts really have changed and these people are not up-to-date. There&#039;s a gap. People are believing something to be true when it&#039;s actually not and when that happens, it&#039;s very dangerous because those people in those businesses start facing a lot of issues and if they don&#039;t change their ways, then eventually those businesses fail and eventually those people who don&#039;t address the issues, they get sick and people even die.


If people don&#039;t evolve and don&#039;t address what&#039;s required of them in their environment or nature, then they really do die. It is so important and as a consultant, your main role is to find niches or markets where the facts have changed but participants haven&#039;t so that you can be that driving force helping them to evolve because when you help people evolve to where the environment is away from where it&#039;s been, if people are clinging back to that and they&#039;re stuck and they&#039;re having issues, then you&#039;re really helping a lot of people when you&#039;re helping that entire niche and the entire market evolve.


That&#039;s a big part of what I&#039;ve been doing in this consulting industry. It&#039;s being very old and very stagnant and boring and it was done traditionally with cold calling and going to visit people in person and wearing suits and all other stuff. Doing massive proposals and charging people per hour and you get my point. It was done pretty much on an abacus. We may as well have bought our own abacus to the business and just sit it up on our disc and start flicking some counters across.


That&#039;s how ancient and the industry was when I first came across it and I noticed that it needed to evolve and I have been the driving force in this industry helping it evolve. As a consultant in your niche, you&#039;re going to be the driving force helping your niche evolve. Some examples like Andrew Argue, he&#039;s one of my seven figure students and he&#039;s helping accounting firms of evolve.


He helps accountants improve their way of getting customers and also improve the way they run their business by helping them get more tech savvy, by helping them understand how to sell, by helping them understand how to market and he&#039;s really helping accountants evolve and get in line with the way the facts have changed.


He&#039;s been able to grow his business. He started working with me in January last year and as of right now, he&#039;s at $500,000 a month which is half a million dollars month, that when he started with me in January last year, he was only at 17,000 a month and that&#039;s because he&#039;s helping an industry that really needs help. They haven&#039;t moved with the times and they&#039;re not up-to-date with the new facts. He is a driving force there.


Hopefully now you can really understand what your main role as a consultant is and what you&#039;re really helping your clients do and the whole niche and market do as a collective group. Here, I have the diagram of how we really add value to people as a consultant and we help people go from their current situation, to their desired situation and we do that by positioning ourselves and our offer as the vehicle to do that.


By helping your niche or your market, bridge the gap from their current situation, to their desired situation. You&#039;re helping them evolve and survive in the forever changing and competitive environment and you&#039;re playing a critical role in nature. You&#039;re really helping people. That is the main role of a consultant.


When you align your business with these principles which I&#039;ve outlined here, it is like a sure fire success. If you find a market where people are distorted from the truth and you&#039;re really helping bring them to the truth and you&#039;re helping add value to people&#039;s lives, you&#039;re going to be rich. That&#039;s how business works.


The amount of money someone makes is a reflection of how much help and how much value they provide to the marketplace. We&#039;ve explained natural selection to you in details and now hopefully you thoroughly understand natural selection which is awesome. It&#039;s a powerful thing you want to constantly be evolving yourself, your mindset, your skills, your knowledge and you also want to be evolving your business all the time because things never go static.


A lot of people think that once they&#039;re good at something, it&#039;s done but that&#039;s not. You&#039;re never done in life. It never ends. The moment you stop evolving, you die. It&#039;s so important to remember that. Now, let&#039;s get back to client attraction and let&#039;s show you how this understanding of natural selection applies to client attraction. How we use natural selection to find the right clients and attract them to us?


The big problem when it comes to client attraction is knowing how to identify the 3% of a niche that is ready to buy now because like I&#039;ve said, only 3% of any niche or market is ready to buy now. That&#039;s not say they won&#039;t buy overtime. Overtime, lots more people are going to buy but I&#039;m talking about right now at any given moment when you&#039;re out there trying to market, now they&#039;re trying to sell. Only 3%.


This is the big problem with attraction, with client attraction. Only 3% of any given market is ready to buy right now and how do we know who the 3% are? Do you know the answer? We use natural selection and this is powerful stuff. Let&#039;s look at some specific examples to help you understand how this process works and really help you understand how natural selection can be used in order to find that 3% that is ready to buy now.


How do animals solve the client selection problem in nature when hunting for food? Here, a lion is faced with the client selection problem and he&#039;s thinking what participants in his chosen niche should he chase and what participants should he ignore. This is pretty much the same problem that we as a business owner face, when we are looking at our niche or our market. We&#039;re looking at a herd of people, they&#039;re categorized together by some characteristic.


Here we&#039;re looking at a big hood of water buffalo, but in business we could be looking at a big herd of plumbers. They&#039;re grouped together with some characteristic, that&#039;s what makes them a niche or a herd or whatever, but we need to know which ones should we chase and which ones should we ignore, what plumbers should we allocate our effort and our attention and our time to and which ones should we ignore, which plumbers are going to buy and which ones are just going to waste our time.


Here, which water buffalo are going to be able to outrun us and which ones are we going to be able to catch if we&#039;re a lion? It really is the same problem we&#039;re faced with. Do you think the lion would chase all of them with equal effort and attention applied to each one? Do you think the lion would run out there after one water buffalo and run after the other? It just wouldn&#039;t work that way. First of all, it&#039;s impossible that it will be gone by that time and it would have scared them all off and he would be too hungry and he&#039;d run out of food and die.


He couldn&#039;t do that and that doesn&#039;t work in nature. You can&#039;t just do things like that in nature. In order to survive, you need to be smarter than that. Lions use natural selection to identify the 3% who are ready to eat now by intimidating the zebra or the water buffalo and then watching the 3% identify themselves. Instead of equally chasing every single one which wouldn&#039;t work, the lion intimidates them and often starts slowly running after them or it steps out in front of them and scares them.


It&#039;s not really trying to catch any particular animal when it first steps out, it&#039;s just trying to make the herd scatter. It&#039;s trying to fragment the herd and see which are the slow ones or the week ones which are going to be hanging at the back or maybe there&#039;s a wounded one which is going to be just an easy picking. When the lion moves out, it just scatters and fragments the herd and it just immediately can see. The herd goes from being like a 1000 water buffalo or a thousand zebra to just being like two or three and that&#039;s how they&#039;re able to do it and they do it with pretty no effort.


They&#039;re not chasing all of them. The lion will be dead by the time it did that. It&#039;s smart. It uses natural selection and the 3% identify themselves. When the lion can see the 3% who are reedy to eat now, he makes his move on them and ignores the rest of the pack, the rest of the herd of zebra or water buffalo. He doesn&#039;t even look at them, he doesn&#039;t care. All he&#039;s worrying about is getting fed now and he has laser focus on the 3%. Lions let natural selection do the work for them and then they make their move on their specific targets.


Once they know what that 3% is, they go for them and they attack them. That&#039;s an example of client selection in nature, but what about client selection and business because we&#039;re not really lions and we&#039;re not really trying to hunt zebras. We&#039;re people in business with a consulting business trying to get consulting clients and make money so some of you might be wondering how do these two things connect? We&#039;ll, you&#039;re going to see how the two were extremely connected.


How do businesses use natural selection to identify the 3% who are reedy to buy now? With the lion, he was looking for the 3% who are ready to eat now. With business, we&#039;re looking for the 3% who are ready to buy now from us and this insight which I&#039;m about to teach you is so profound that if you understand it correctly, you will be unstoppable in business. If you thoroughly understand what I&#039;m about to show you here like I can&#039;t see any possible case how you couldn&#039;t become extremely rich because it&#039;s just probably the most powerful driving force in all of business.


This example really, really explains things clearly. It&#039;s just like the lion example. It&#039;s a specific example and this happened in real life and I&#039;ve called it how Steve Madden Shoes use natural selection to identify the 3% of shoe designs that customers were willing to buy now. Steve Madden had basically ... We&#039;ll, I&#039;ll go through the story here. Steve Madden Shoes had 20 or more, I think it could in between 20 or 30 shoe designs and Steve Madden, he was a guy and he designed all of these shoes and he thought they were all really good.


Other members of the company thought they were all really good too and they couldn&#039;t figure out which once should we cut and which ones should we not stock and which ones should we stock because it was a really tough decision. They didn&#039;t really know. Then they were confronted with a big issue. They had 20 plus shoe designs and they couldn&#039;t afford to manufacture large supplies of all of them. Department stores were not willing to stock 20 plus different shoes either since retail space is precious and valuable.


You imagine you&#039;ve got 20 shoe designs, well if you&#039;re going to get different shops to stock them for you, they&#039;re going to want inventory and you&#039;ve got to provide that inventory to them and you don&#039;t really know which inventory is going to move and which inventory is going to sell and what inventory is not going to sell.


The last thing you want to have in retail is stale inventory which is the inventory which you can&#039;t sell because that&#039;s just pure wasted money and that&#039;s how you go bankrupt, but the other thing you don&#039;t want to happen is you don&#039;t want to not manufacture or you don&#039;t want to not manufacture enough of anyone particular item because if it ends up being a hot item and selling just everywhere and everyone loves it, then it sells out real fast and customers can&#039;t buy it and you can&#039;t produce it because you&#039;ve already done your run of manufacturing and you&#039;re again, you have massive missed opportunity.


Manufacturing businesses are faced with this massive problem and Steve Madden had 20 of the shoe designs and they didn&#039;t know which ones to go with and which ones not to go with and not only that, but they didn&#039;t know what sizes to manufacture. With shoes, you&#039;ve got different colors and different sizes and you&#039;ve really got to predict with a lot of accuracy what designs are going to sell and how many of them and then within those designs, what colors and then within those designs and colors, what different sizes.


You think about that for a moment. It&#039;s a very, very tough issue to be faced with. How could Steve Madden Shoes predict what shoes would be liked by their niche or their market ahead of time? How could they know? How could they really have a crystal ball and be able to predict what is going to happen in the future? What sizes are going to sell, what colors, what style, everything.


A lot of people think this is an impossible task and pretty much for I would say 99.999% of the world thinks this is an impossible task but it&#039;s not we can do something very smart here and how could they identify the 3% of shoe designs that their niche or their market was ready to buy now? How did they know what those three designs were?


Well, they used natural selection. Just like the lion did. Steve Madden shoes set up three display stores in popular locations around America like New York City and Manhattan and in LA and different, I think they had four shops which they set up which were in hot areas where trendy people were and trendsetters were and early adopting customers were. They set up four stores and then they stocked them with all 20 shoe designs.


They manufactured all 20 shoe designs, but they did something really, really, really smart and they only stocked the stores with one pair of shoes per design and they had no additional sizes and no additional stock or inventory. Each one of these stores it had the range of 20 different designs, but they didn&#039;t have any inventory and they didn&#039;t have any different sizes. They&#039;d literally just had the shoes that were on display. They had absolutely no inventory. Just what was displaying on the shelf. I&#039;d be thinking there, it&#039;s crazy. That&#039;s stupid. Why would they do that?


What they did was pure genius and they set up the stores to test what shoe designs their niche and market were ready to buy now and the people would say they wanted to buy a pair shoes and then Steve Madden the company would mark that design with one point and then apologize to the customer because they couldn&#039;t sell it to them but they could do a back order. What happened is people came into these different stores and they walked around and they spotted the ones they liked and everything and then they&#039;d asked the staff, they&#039;d be like, &quot;Hey, I want to get these ones or I want to try these ones on.&quot;


The staff were cleverly recording all of this down on paper and everything and they were able to see which items, which shoe designs people were interested in purchasing and then they couldn&#039;t sell it to them because they only had one item of each shoe, but they would offer to take ... they would apologize, they would offer to take people&#039;s names down and then they&#039;d called them back when they had it in stock. A lot of people left their name and everything. At the end of their testing period which was about two weeks, now only really 14 days because they are in high foot traffic areas and central big cities.


They knew which shoes their niche wanted and was ready to buy now and they knew which shoes were a total failure. They had 20 designs. They knew the two designs which were hot and everyone wanted to buy and then they knew all the other designs which were not hot and no one was even interested and no one even really looked at them. They were able to tell who the winners were and what the winning shoes were and what the losing shoes were.


They let natural selection do the work for them so they could identify the 3% of shoes that their niche and their market were ready to buy now and not only that, they knew the 3% of sizes too and this is just pure genius because as a manufacturer, you&#039;ve got to predict not only the designs that you&#039;re going to sell, but then you&#039;ve got to predict of those designs what colors. Steve Madden knew the colors as well. They knew that these ones were more popular than these ones and they also knew that this color and that model was more popular than that and not only that as if it couldn&#039;t get any better.


They also knew what sizes because out of all the people that came in, they recorded the size, the color and the shoe design that their market wanted and what they found is that there was skewed distribution in every single one. Most people wanted to buy one design of shoe and one particular color and most of them wanted it in this one size. That&#039;s often what we see everywhere in the world and everywhere in life and business is distribution is never evenly spread. Its massively skewed, that&#039;s how we get the 80/20 principle and things like that.


What they noticed is that they just needed to order pretty much out of all the shoe designs they had, only two of them were really worth manufacturing. The risk weren&#039;t even worth worrying about. They knew the two and they knew what colors the two needed to be in and they knew what sizes those needed to be in. They were able to accurately or they were able to predict that and they knew what the 3%, what our 3% of shoe designs, colors, sizes the market wanted and they did this through using natural selection.


Just like the lion moved out into and stood in front of the herd of zebra or the herd of water buffalo, he doesn&#039;t even move. He&#039;s not even trying to catch anything at first. He&#039;s just standing out to scatter the herd and fragment it and see which are the weak ones in the pack so that he can just chase after one of them and not have to worry about all the others.


What Steve Madden did is they set up these stores and then they had their market come in and they were able to identify which ones they were going to ... which ones were going to sell really well and the two strategies are pretty much identical. Both of these examples, both with the lion and with Steve Madden is an example of natural selection and as soon as they knew what shoe designs and sizes were hot, they started manufacturing those specific ones in bulk because they knew that conviction that these ones were hot.


They called up the manufacturers and they just started manufacturing them in massive quantities and then, they provided them to the department stores to stock on their shelves for distribution. Instead of building their own shops and everything, they just pretty much closed down those test shops, they were only pop-up stores. What they did is they knew that these shoes and these colors and in these design and in these sizes were hot because they had done their test.


They called up all the different department stores and said, &quot;We know, we guarantee that these shoes are going to sell.&quot; The department store takes a bit of inventory and it tries it out and sees if they&#039;re going to sell or not and if those shoes don&#039;t sell, then the department store send them back and they&#039;re like, &quot;We don&#039;t want to stock your shoes. These things don&#039;t make us any money.&quot; But what happened is when these different department store stocked Steve Madden Shoes, they just sold like hotcakes.


They&#039;re the hottest selling items in the entire store. The department store kept calling back Steve Madden. They keep providing them with more inventory. It just went crazy. The shoe designs were the hottest selling shoes in all of the department stores and they sold like hotcakes. Steve Madden shoes these days and back then as well when I&#039;m talking about the story, it sells 200,000,000 pairs of shoes each year and it makes $1.4 billion each year. This is just a shoe company and it was started by just a dude like making shoes in his house.


They sell 200 million shoes. That means they attract 200 million customers and they make 1.4 billion a year. The company&#039;s worth billions. This is the power of natural selection. It is so powerful that I can hardly get ... I&#039;m trying to get my point across as much as possible, but this, using natural selection is the most powerful thing you can possibly do in life and business because you&#039;re seeing what preference of trait nature itself has said and its genetic programming.


Once you can see which trait nature wants, then we&#039;re just stepping in as a supplier of that trait. If we&#039;re in our particular niche and we do our testing and everything and we find that one particular people have one particular problem and they need to solve it by doing this one particular thing. If they do that, then things are going to be good. Well, we know within our niche what nature has said as its preferences for genetic traits and now we&#039;re just the supplier of those genetic traits and we know it&#039;s going to work because that&#039;s the preferences which nature has set for it.


It&#039;s like an example of the green and brown Beetles where this bird kept coming in, flying in and picking off the green beetles. Imagine if one of the beetles was able to sell like ... was able to sell a colored transformation service. They set up a little shop and they were like, &quot;Come in here and we will transform your shell brown overnight and it costs this much money.&quot; Well, that would be the richest beetle in the world.


If they knew how to do all of that stuff which they don&#039;t but you get my point and it&#039;s like, imagine if it&#039;s an enterprising zebra set up shop and it started selling like special services and training to help them run at the front of the herd when a lion steps out and intimidates the pack and separates everyone and gets them to scatter.


Well, that would be an awesome thing to buy and those two situations with the beetles and with the zebras, those services are so crucial that they&#039;re crucial for the survival of the individual. It&#039;s like the beetle or the zebra is buying life extension. It&#039;s busy buying survival. That is how powerful natural selection is. That is why we use it. We really want to be attuned to our niche and we want to know their problems, pains, fears and desires and we also want to iterate and keep testing and keep forming hypothesis and seeing which ones are accepted by the market and which ones are rejected.


It&#039;s amazing how quickly it happens. With this process which I&#039;ve set out in this program, you&#039;re able to very quickly see what nature has set its preferences for in genetic traits and genetic mutations within participants in that market. We literally have in this program a framework and a methodology for observing a niche in a marketplace and doing specific actions to see the actual preferences that nature has set ahead of time for the evolution of the species and then we&#039;re coming in as a supplier of that evolutionary trait which is required for the survival of the participants.


Andrew Argue and the accounting niche, he did his hypotheses and his iterations and everything and he struck on the ... He really understood. He thoroughly understood what preferences nature had set for traits for accountants and he could see that accountants were behind the times, they needed to learn how to sell, they needed to learn how to market and get customers and they also needed to get their businesses online and they needed to really lean their businesses up.


They were usually really old school paper-based in these offices with all of these different staff doing things that computers could easily do. He could see the preferences which nature had set for accounting and accountants and inside the accounting niche, the accounting environment and now he is selling training and services and advice on how to become more evolved and how to really add those those traits to your business so that you can win and survive in the accounting environment.


That truly is what he&#039;s doing. If people, if accountants in the accounting environment don&#039;t take Andrew up on his offer or don&#039;t educate themselves on how to evolve, then their businesses are going to get wiped out. If people in the consulting industry and in my consulting niche, if they don&#039;t educate themselves or if they don&#039;t buy my program and learn, well they&#039;re going to get wiped out.


I mean, I&#039;m training people every single day on how to be a seriously powerful consultant. I mean you&#039;ve been through this training. This thing is like nothing else there is out there. If someone has this training in their hands, they are dangerous. If someone has this training in their hands, it&#039;s bad news for the other people in their niche because they&#039;re just going to turn like into a super human species within their niche because they&#039;re so much more evolved. They&#039;re so much more intelligent, so much more agile.


If you&#039;ve got this training in your niche, then you should be among the most evolved within that particular niche and you&#039;re able to help the other less evolved people out by helping them obtain those evolutionary traits which are required for survival in nature. Hopefully, you understood what the main message I&#039;m trying to get across here with natural selection and how powerful it is because I&#039;ve looked at a lot of different forces in business and in life and mindset and everything.


When it comes to making money, mindset is important, sales is important, but truly I think one of the things which I have which really contributes to my success is my ability to really know what nature has selected in terms of its preference in traits. I&#039;m able to see what species has an advantage and what species is at a disadvantage whether it&#039;s businesses, whether it&#039;s people, societies, anything and I&#039;m able to very accurately predict what&#039;s going to happen with different things.


When I&#039;m able to do that, I&#039;m able to step in as a supplier and really help people out and make a lot of money in the process. It&#039;s like being able to be a beetle that sells color-changing services to other beetles so they can escape those birds. That&#039;s really what I&#039;m able to do in my niche. Here is a direct comparison. We&#039;ve got natural selection in nature. Lions solve the client attraction problem by stimulating the market and watching the 3% identify themselves.


They don&#039;t even really chase them. You can watch a video on YouTube of lions catching prey. They don&#039;t just start running. They just stand out there just chilled out. Then they just intimidate the herd and then the whole herd starts running and scattering and fragmenting and the lions just chilling out watching what&#039;s going on and then it&#039;s able to see that 3% and once they know who the 3% are, they move on them with conviction.


Once they lock eyes on the one which they are going to catch, it&#039;s game over. Once they lock on that target, it&#039;s done. They move on them with conviction and they catch them and they always get their pride. Once they set on that target, it&#039;s done and this is an example of survival of the fittest and only the strong survive. Within the zebras as zebras ... let&#039;s say zebra or water buffalo is a niche or a species, the zebra or the water buffalo which are good at spotting lions and good at positioning themselves in herds so that they can quickly run or that train themselves to be fit and fast, they&#039;re going to survive.


Those species who can adapt and everything, they&#039;re going to survive and they&#039;re going to outlive the other ones and then natural selection and business. Steve Madden Shoes solved the client attraction problem by stimulating the market and watching the 3% identify themselves. They set up the shops. They put the 20 plus shoes in there and then they let people come in and they saw which ones people wanted and which ones they didn&#039;t.


Once they knew what the 3% were, what the 3% of shoe designs were, once they knew what the hot designs were, they moved on them with conviction so they moved on it just like that lion moved on that zebra once it locks its eyes on it. They called out manufacturers and they just ... they went big on manufacturing and then they went to the distribution chains which were the retail stores and they are the department stores and they provided a lot of volume.


Survival of the fittest. Only the strong survive. In the species of shoe designs or different shoes, only the shoes which were selected by the customers in the initial test were manufactured and actually went to market. All the other shoes which didn&#039;t get selected by the market just got put in the trash. They never even got manufactured. They never even got put in department stores. They just got culled from nature and only really two pairs of shoes made the cut and actually started getting distributed.


This is an example of natural selection in both cases. When it comes to client attraction for your consulting business, how do you use natural selection to identify the 3% of your niche who are ready to buy now? Just like the lion looking at the herd and just like Steve Madden Shoes looking at all of the different shoe designs, how do we know the 3% of our niche or our market who is ready to buy now?


This is how we use natural selection to identify the 3%. Four-step process. Number one is you must have a specific niche market selected in order to target them. For example, if a lion is hungry and it goes out and it doesn&#039;t really know what it wants to eat and if it&#039;s like, &quot;Well, maybe I&#039;ll chase a water buffalo, then I&#039;ll chase this thing and this thing. I don&#039;t even really know what I&#039;m going to after.&quot; In any case, if an animal in nature doesn&#039;t know what it wants, it&#039;s never going to get it.


With any business, if they don&#039;t have a niche and if they don&#039;t know specifically who their herd is or what herd they&#039;re going for, then they&#039;re never going to be able to find it. First thing you must have a niche and everyone should have a niche by now because we got that out of the way in week one. Number two, you must do some research to understand your market&#039;s problems, pains and desires before hand and hypothesize about what you think will happen when you apply your niche-offer-result formula.


We did this in week one. We did research and we talked to our market and we came up, we took a view on the market and we really came up with what we thought the market needed and we came out with our hypothesis, our niche-offer-result hypothesis worksheet. We created that. To give you an example here, if you don&#039;t do some research and understand your market, then it&#039;s like being a baby, it&#039;s like being a small baby zebra or something in nature and it not knowing whether it can eat a lion or not.


Let&#039;s say there&#039;s this massive herd of ... there&#039;s this massive pack of lions like 13 massive lions just lying on the ground and the small tiny zebra thinks, &quot;Okay, well I&#039;m just going to run out there and I&#039;m going to go and eat a lion.&quot; Well, if that zebra runs out there in front of those lions thinking that it&#039;s going to be able to eat one of them, it&#039;s going to get eaten itself and it&#039;s going to get wiped out. It&#039;s going to die.


This is what happens when you don&#039;t do your research and when you don&#039;t have a hypothesis beforehand and when you don&#039;t test things hypothetically before doing them in real life. If in nature, if that small zebra was able to do some research and form a hypothesis, then it would find out that that was a really, that idea was stupid and that that idea probably wouldn&#039;t work. I know that&#039;s an extreme example, but it&#039;s the same thing. We need to do our research first and we need to understand the market and its problems, pains and desires beforehand.


Then we need to form a hypothesis about what we think will happen and only once we&#039;ve done that do we actually go and take action because it is so important to do that and then step three, you must stimulate your niche market with a piece of stimulus designed to appeal to their problems, pains and desires and solicit a response. When you do this, your niche market should fragment and you should be able to identify the 3% of people who are ready to buy now. Just like the lion stands out in front of the herd of zebra, it intimidates them by doing that and then the whole pack just starts scattering and fragmenting.


The lion just waits and then it can see the three or the one which it&#039;s going to go after and then it goes after them. When we do this, we are putting out an ad like we&#039;re putting in, we&#039;re putting out an ad on Facebook or we&#039;re sending out emails to different people or we&#039;re sending out direct mail to different people and those marketing messages and those things we put in front of people, that is our stimulus. That is our way of standing in front of the herd and watching it fragment and scatter.


What happens is when we send out some emails to let&#039;s say a hundred people, most people probably won&#039;t reply and those are kind of like the ... that&#039;s kind of like the people that run away in the herd of zebra like most of them disappear and then there&#039;s some left at the end and you&#039;re able to see what a natural selection has done. When you send out an email to a hundred people, only ... Let&#039;s say only 20 people reply and then you go through some more emails trying to learn more information and then you try to set up a phone call.


That group of 20 people who replied then that thins down into a group of say 10 people and then you try and get them on the phone and then that thins down to a group of five people, then you speak to all five people on the phone and then one out of that five ends up buying and becoming a client. That&#039;s natural selection right there.


That is it at work so the initial thing which we&#039;re doing is putting the ad or sending out the email and then that&#039;s the initial scattering of the herd and then we send some more emails that&#039;s more scattering and thinning of the herd and then we get them on the phone, more scattering and then once we have them on the phone and we close them, that&#039;s the final one which we end up with in any case.


It&#039;s just like when a lion goes after a herd, it stands in front of them, watches them scatter and then it sees a small little group of maybe three or four hanging back that might be wounded or young or something and then lion starts running after them and then as it runs, that group of five will start to fragment to and then it ends up with just one at the end. That&#039;s the same thing except in our case, we&#039;re not going out and eating people in our market.


We&#039;re actually going out and helping people in our market. Don&#039;t get those two things mixed up. When we work with someone as a consultant, we&#039;re helping them get stronger and we&#039;re helping them evolve more so that they actually don&#039;t become one of the species that gets wiped out. We&#039;re doing quite the opposite of the lion. It&#039;s more like we are trying to protect our niche and our clients from getting caught by the lion, but in any case this is still natural selection at work and this is how we play our role.


This is really powerful because instead of just chasing after all of them or confusing ourselves about forever trying to figure out what ones do we go after and what ones do we not go after, we get to find out for sure who we should spend our time on and that way we get to allocate our resources, our time and our attention on the people that are highly likely to buy and then forget about the other people who are going to waste our time just like the lion is not going to bother trying to chase everything.


He&#039;ll starve and die before he gets anything to eat. When you identify the 3% of your niche market who are ready to buy now, you must strike immediately with conviction and convert them into a paying client and you should forget about the rest of the market. Let&#039;s say you send out a hundred emails and then you start emailing, you reply back to different people, you get them on the phone.


When you find someone who&#039;s the perfect fit, you have to strike and get them on the phone. Once the lion has scattered the herd and fragmented the herd, he doesn&#039;t think, &quot;I&#039;ll chase that one tomorrow.&quot; Because tomorrow that is gone. When you do this stuff and you identify somebody who is hot and likely to buy your services, you&#039;ve got to strike. You got to strike while the iron&#039;s hot because it won&#039;t just to stay hot. That&#039;s how it works and this is how we use natural selection to identify the 3% of people in any niche market who are likely to buy now.


The truth is that only 3% of your niche market will be ready to evolve at this current moment in time by purchasing your consulting services. Even though we, it might be absolutely abundantly clear that people within a particular niche need to evolve, otherwise they risk getting wiped out. It might not be clear. It often never is clear to the people in the market. They often are hanging on to the old facts and they haven&#039;t adjusted to the facts, the new facts.


Only 3% of any niche market is ready to evolve at this current moment in time and that&#039;s how it happens. It happens gradually. There&#039;s a group of people who usually move early and then as more people start to move and more, a more, a more it speeds up but in any given point in time, only 3% of any niche market is really ready to evolve. Instead of trying to fight nature, we go with it and use it as a tool to our advantage. I see so many companies out there just dialing numbers, cold calling and just punching the phones and they&#039;re trying to brute force their way through their business.


Like I said, it&#039;s better than doing nothing. If you&#039;re doing nothing, well it&#039;s way better be doing that but it&#039;s a very inefficient strategy. Trying to charge through a massive number and just of people and trying to just dial them all is really fighting nature and whenever you fight nature, you don&#039;t come out too well. With our process and our methodology and our understanding of everything, we use nature to do all the hard work for us. We let it thin the herd for us without breaking a sweat and then once we know who we need to go for, we go for them.


That way, we&#039;re able to run our business with a hundred times more productivity and a hundred times more efficiency. My business, it&#039;s as ... Last year, we did 18.25 million. This year, we&#039;re on track to do 50 million. At this point in time, I have almost 20 stuff. Just to give you some perspective, my accountants, they see that the average business that makes as much money as mine has a thousand stuff. Think about it for a minute.


The average business that makes the amount of profits that mine does has 1000 stuff, but my business somehow has 18. What is going on there? There&#039;s a big difference between a thousand stuff and 18 and we should be able to get to a hundred million with 50. That&#039;s unheard of. There&#039;s no companies that do that. It&#039;s like you&#039;re a total unicorn if you do that and you have to ask, &quot;How does that happen? Why?&quot; It&#039;s because I am using natural selection and I&#039;m using these forces to my advantage.


It means I&#039;m not just trying to use brute force and just trying to exert a whole lot of energy. I&#039;m being really, really strategic and really smart when it comes to who do we target, how do we target them and how do we really stand in front of the market and thin the herd and know where we should allocate our time and our resources and our money. In every single instance in my business, I use natural selection to determine which particular area I should put my focus, attention, time, resources, money everything. I always use natural selection as a way to find that sweet spot to apply the pressure to.


This is the alchemy of client attraction. This is the real art and the science behind it and I wanted to give you an in depth understanding of that because I think if you understand that, it&#039;s going to serve you in so many other ways other than just trying to get clients. Don&#039;t get me wrong. It&#039;s going to serve you immensely when it comes to getting clients which is awesome.


It&#039;s going to make you a lot of money but not only that, it&#039;s going to help you in the development of your mindset, it&#039;s going to help you in the development of yourself. It&#039;s going to help you in the development of everything because now when you&#039;re faced with a decision and you have a large number of possible futures to choose from, you can use natural selection and you can ... to really show you which choice of possible futures are the optimal choices.


When you&#039;re able to do that, life becomes really easy. For me, everyday, if you think about a human being moving through life on any given day, they have an infinite amount of information and they have all of these different choices of possible futures. Take this action. This might happen in the future. Take this action. This might happen in the future. There&#039;s all of these possible futures available for a person and I don&#039;t know what to do and often they make the wrong decisions or often they make a decision thinking it&#039;s going to work and it doesn&#039;t.


When you use natural selection, you&#039;re able to create small testing environments to get foresight into what&#039;s going to happen in the future by seeing the preference that nature has set in its traits of its evolutionary traits, the ones that nature prefers and when you&#039;re able to do that, you&#039;re able to accurately predict what&#039;s going to happen in the future. Not a 100% of the time, otherwise I would be the richest person in the entire world.


I&#039;m still working on this, plus I haven&#039;t even been in business for very long. I still make mistakes, not 100% perfect, but it is one of the reasons why I have been able to make such big bold moves in different areas of life and business and be able to go against the odds and against the status quo and pull through and really flip things over and change things because I&#039;m able to ... I&#039;m very attuned to what nature&#039;s preference is and different traits.


While others use brute force to identify clients and in their niche market, we use the fundamental driving force behind evolution and nature. This is our client acquisition methodology so I&#039;m going to show you the process at a high level view just again so I can show you how we use this as a natural selection process because now that I&#039;ve explained natural selection to you, this will make sense in a totally different way. Here&#039;s our client acquisition methodology.


We have paid methods and organic methods, this is how we get in front of our clients and get their attention, then we have a value video then our survey and then our call. Very simple process. This is how we take a total stranger to a paying client of ours and this first section here with the gray background is our stimulus. Imagine a bird flying over the beetles, when the birds flying over, all the beetles start scattering and then the bird can see like a few that are left or a few that are slower than the others and then it knows which ones to target and which ones to die for or when the lions steps out in front of the herd of zebra, it&#039;s able to see the herd fragment and scatter and it&#039;s able to target a particular group or a particular zebra and then it&#039;s able to go for them.


When the zebra stand ... when the lion stands out in front of the zebras, that its stimulus. A stimulus is a way to stimulate and agitate the herd and for us to do that with our consulting business, we use paid methods and we also use organic methods. Paid ones cost money, but they can scale high. Organic ones are free and quick but they&#039;re often not that good with scale. The second part of the process, once we&#039;ve scattered the herd and fragmented it then we need a fragmentation funnel.


This is the value video, the survey and the call because once we&#039;ve just fragmented the herd initially, it&#039;s not fragmented enough. If we send an emails out to a hundred people and 20 people reply, well that&#039;s still not fragmented enough because if we speak to all 20 people on the phone for an hour, if only one of them buys, that means we really wasted like 19 hours because we weren&#039;t able to better identify the cluster in which the one client existed.


Just like if a zebra ... If a lion was stood out and it fragmented a herd, if there&#039;s a hundred, if there&#039;s only a hundred zebra left in one pack, that&#039;s not fragmented enough. The lion still can&#039;t chase 100 zebra. It needs to fragment it further. In order to do that, it starts running after the whole hundred and then the herd starts fragmenting further and further and further and only at the point where there&#039;s one left really does the lion attack and eat.


Our fragmentation funnel is how we really continue to thin that herd and end up with the 3% of people on the phone ready to talk to us. Once they get on the phone, we still have more fragmenting to do. We still have to thin the herd more and that&#039;s why people we talk, some people we talk to won&#039;t buy. If we talk to five people, only one might buy. The average closing ratio for most people in this training program is 20% and that&#039;s very good by the way.


20% means that out of every five people you have a phone call with, only one buys. Even once we get people on the call, more fragmentation and more scattering of the herd is necessary and that&#039;s what we do with the alchemic conversion script. It&#039;s designed in a way in which we further thin that herd and then we only make offers to the people which we can help and then out of the people we make offers to, only some of them accept and that&#039;s how we end up taking a market of thousands of people and really thinning it down to one person and bringing them on as a client.


It doesn&#039;t matter that with thinning a herd of thousands or millions or whatever into just one at a time because we can come back and feed as much as we want. Just like the lion, it doesn&#039;t need to get to at one time. It doesn&#039;t need to get a hundred at one time. That&#039;s stupid because it doesn&#039;t need it and it&#039;s also impossible. For us, I think a lot of people think that they&#039;re letting the rest of the market get away and they&#039;re letting the rest of the market go to waste, but it couldn&#039;t be further from the truth.


You can only really deal with one thing at a time. This process works very well. Once you&#039;ve closed the client and enrolled them in your services or your coaching or consulting program, then you go back to the market. You do it again and you can do it again and again. You could do it six times a day if you wanted. That&#039;s how it works. What we&#039;re going to discuss in this module and in this week which is week four, the alchemy of client attraction, we&#039;re going to discuss the stimulus.


I&#039;ve really discussed the whole science and everything behind it. Now, we&#039;re going to dive into the specific stimulus. What are the paid methods we use and what are the organic methods? What do they look like? What are they? How do we use them? And when should we use paid? When should we use organic? All those things. Now, that you understand the science behind our client attraction process, let&#039;s discuss the specifics and let&#039;s take a look at the different types of stimulus we use to revoke a response from our niche market.


There&#039;s two different types of stimulus that we use and I&#039;ve told you this. Organic and paid. I will introduce you to all of our organic attraction methods as well as our paid methods, but before we do that, let&#039;s discuss first of all what makes a good stimulus because most people get their priorities mixed up when it comes to creating a powerful nerve-striking stimulus and when creating a powerful stimulus, your message is the most important part. The method we use to show the message to your niche market is just a vehicle to deliver the message so whether we&#039;re using organic or paid or anything, that isn&#039;t which one we choose, which method we choose to deliver the message, it&#039;s just a delivery vehicle.


What&#039;s inside the delivery vehicle is the most important thing and that is your message. Now, if your message which we designed in week one in the module resonating your message, your message is the most important thing when it comes to client attraction. It doesn&#039;t matter how awesome your ... it doesn&#039;t matter how awesome your fragmentation process and your funnel is, it doesn&#039;t matter how awesome you are at Facebook ads and how much technology you have and everything.


If your marketing message doesn&#039;t strike a nerve with your niche, then it&#039;s not going to work so a lot of people get this confused. They think it&#039;s all about Facebook ads and all about funnels when in reality, the message is much more important than Facebook ads and funnels. To bring this into perspective, if a rabbit runs out in front of a herd of zebra, the herd of zebra isn&#039;t going to do anything. They probably won&#039;t even see the rabbit and if any one of the zebra sees the rabbit. They&#039;re aren&#039;t going to care.


They&#039;re just going to be like and continue eating the grass. That is exactly what happens when people use Facebook ads and they have a lousy message. They think they&#039;re going into this market with all of this firepower and everything because they&#039;re using Facebook ads and they&#039;ve got an awesome funnel and they&#039;ve got all of the technical stuff but their message is lame.


They stand out in front of the herd which is their niche or their market thinking that big things are going to happen, but they just look like a nobody to the niche and the niche doesn&#039;t even notice. That brings it in perspective. If your message doesn&#039;t strike a nerve, then the you&#039;re not going to get the herd to scatter and take action. You need to be able to strike a nerve.


When a lion walks out in front of a pack of zebra, they move and you can just watch it on YouTube. When that thing stands out in front. The herd scatters. This is fascinating. I was looking at some of this in my research but genetically, all living things have programmed into their DNA and hardwired into their psychology and everything since before they&#039;re born about what to avoid and what to and what to be attracted to.


There&#039;s this fascinated example where they found field mice and they brought them into a lab and they had these field mice were brand new, they had never been outside. They were born inside of this lab. These field mice had never seen any predators ever in their entire life because they had never been outside of the laboratory. What they did is they had a screen over the top of the enclosure and they would play videos of different shapes and things which would appear to be flying over the field mice like a square moving across, mice didn&#039;t do anything. They tried triangles. They&#039;d tried all different things then they started getting really creative.


The field mice didn&#039;t even notice anything on the TV which was on the roof of their enclosure. They didn&#039;t even flinch or look at anything, it&#039;s like the TV wasn&#039;t there, but then this is what will blow your mind. They then got an eagle like a video recording of an eagle. They played a video of the eagle flying across on the TV screen and this isn&#039;t even a real eagle. Remember, this is just a video recording and then the field mice didn&#039;t respond to anything else, but as soon as that eagle was going across on the TV, all the field mice just scattered. They disappeared.


What&#039;s really interesting about that is that those field mice had never even been outside. They were born inside in a lab and they had no idea what an eagle was. They had never seen one before. It was impossible and what happened is when they saw one, they knew to run away and what that means is that in their DNA and in their programming, so deep in their programming, that is in there as a genetic survival response.


That&#039;s how deep that is that they don&#039;t even need to learn that. They just know it from the moment they&#039;re born. That&#039;s an example of a powerful stimulus. If you are marketing to field mice, if you&#039;re trying to get the attention of field mice and you put a video of a eagle flying over them, you would scatter the herd. If you were a lion and you were trying ... If you were trying to scatter the herd of zebra, you would put a lion out there and it would scatter it.


This is what I mean by a stimulus. It has to be powerful. It has to strike a nerve and it has to really get at something inside the psyche of the participant within the niche in order to really strike a nerve and get them to react and respond because only when they do that are you able to thin the herd and spot the different ... the 3% which are going to make likely clients for your business.


When we&#039;re looking at it like that and when we put it in perspective like that, the message is the most important thing. The vehicle to deliver the message in the field mice example was just the TV. The TV, it&#039;s just a vehicle for delivering the message. The message was the eagle. That is a powerful thing which I want to make sure everybody understands. We covered messaging in detail in week one of the program and it&#039;s in the resonating your message module.


If you want to learn more about messaging, I mean you should already know a lot about it. I taught it in detail in week one, you should already have your message hypothesis worksheet and should be ready to go to the market and start testing your message and iterating it to get it to the point where it does strike nerves but if you want to go back and recap on that training, the module is called resonating your message. It&#039;s in week one.


Your message is how you get the attention of your niche market and to create it we use this simple formula. I help niche to get result by offer so I help blank to blank by blank and we fill in these variables. Andrew Argue could say, &quot;I help accountants to get a high value accounting clients through Facebook ads and through technology and Facebook ads.&quot; But he also teaches them how to sell and things like that.


I say to people, &quot;I&#039;ll help you grow your consulting business by getting more clients in a predictable way through Facebook ads, funnels and proven sales processes and methodologies.&quot; Or you could say, &quot;I help women over 30 to lose weight through yoga and pilates.&quot; Or &quot;I help CEOs improve their wardrobe so that they have increased confidence when they&#039;re at the office so that they can improve their careers and everything.&quot; This is the formula which we use and when you get this formula right, it will strike a nerve with your market and as the herd will scatter, people will respond to the message, you will start getting clients and making money.


A strong message is just like when a lion walks out in front of a pack of zebra and it just scatters. Remember that your message is the most important thing when it comes to creating a nerve-striking stimulus and the method we use is just a vehicle to deliver it. Now, let&#039;s introduce you to our different client attraction methods and we have two categories of client attraction methods, organic methods and paid methods. Most people think that I get all of my clients from paid Facebook ads and that&#039;s it, but that&#039;s not the case at all.


Here&#039;s my monthly sales volume by source, split out and segmented on a chart so it&#039;s all very clear. Here&#039;s my monthly sales volume. 20% of my sales derived from list-farming which means emailing my list, inviting them to webinars, things like that. 20% of my sales volume comes from direct outreach so actually reaching out to people, seeing someone who I think needs my services, reaching out to them on Facebook chat or reaching out to them through email.


Andrew Argue, I got through direct outreach and Chris Evans and Taylor Welch, I got them through direct outreach. A lot of my seven-figure case studies and a lot of my top students, my millionaire students, I got through direct outreach and a lot of people think direct outreach, it doesn&#039;t work or it&#039;s too simple or anything because they just want to do the ads, but the truth is it&#039;s very powerful and I still use it today. Then 20% of my sales come from organic Facebook so just creating a post on my personal Facebook page and on my personal Facebook profile, not my business Facebook page.


Just saying like just putting my marketing message out there and asking people if they&#039;re interested in solving this problem or getting this result and if they are, just call me and to send me a message and I get 20% of my sales through that and then the remaining 40% I get through paid advertising using Facebook ads. This is how it is segmented like this and what&#039;s interesting is that the red, blue and green areas of this chart, list farming, direct outreach and organic Facebook, all three of these are organic methods which means that 60% of my sales come from organic and only 40% from paid.


While a lot of people believe that a 100% of my sales come from Facebook ads, only 40% does and 60% come from these other organic methods. 60% of my monthly sales volume comes from organic methods while 40% comes from paid methods. If a lot of people I see them shoot themselves in their foot, they just do paid methods and they ignore organic. If you do that, you&#039;re leaving 60% of the money on the table. If there&#039;s a million dollars to be made, you&#039;re only taking 400,000 of it and you&#039;re letting the other 600,000 just sit out there for someone else.


Let&#039;s discuss organic attraction methods right now. Let&#039;s discuss what they are, how they work, all of that stuff. Organic attraction methods are free, fast, easy to use methods that we use in order to stimulate our niche market and identify the 3% who are ready to buy now. These are methods which we can use to thin the herd and scatter it and fragment it and identify those people who we&#039;re going to be able to sell.


What what makes it different is that it&#039;s free to use. Organic methods are free to use and they&#039;re fast. We can get them deployed quickly. We can scatter that herd quickly and we can get a client quickly and they&#039;re also easy to use. The advantage of using organic methods is they&#039;re fast to set up and deploy, easy to understand, they are low tech. There&#039;s not any technology really involved at all and they&#039;re free or close to free and they enable you to get moving quickly so you can get your first client ASAP.


Some of them are actually 100% free and some of them are almost free that I&#039;ve put them in the free category anyway because they don&#039;t cost that much. The disadvantages of using organic methods is while they are fast to deploy, they require manual labor to do consistently and they become a burden with scale. Organic methods are awesome in the beginning but if you try and grow your business like into the big numbers like high six figures, seven figures, eight figures, if you try and push for massive scale with organic methods, it becomes a big burden because there&#039;s so much manual labor required and often the processes break down and get complicated.


It&#039;s generally best when you&#039;re starting out and you don&#039;t have any clients or you&#039;ve just got a few clients. They work really well then, but once you get a bit bigger you use the paid methods to scale. The ideal use case and application for organic methods. You should use organic methods to get started immediately and land your first few clients so that you can iterate and establish a proof of concept as quickly as possible.


In these early stages when we&#039;re going out to the market and testing our hypothesis and seeing what we need to improve and what we need to do more of and what we need to do less of when we&#039;re iterating and we&#039;re trying to find out what nature has selected for our niche in these developments. We want to use organic methods because they&#039;re cheap, they&#039;re fast and we want to use things that are cheap and fast while we are trying to get proof of concept.


As soon as we have proof of concept, then we want to just make that proof of concept stronger, we can continue to do that using organic methods and once we have that strong proof of concept, then we want to start deploying some paid client attraction methods to start scaling things up. That is the ideal use case and application. We have five organic attraction methods that we teach you in this training program and here they are. Number one is organic Facebook posts which are posts on your personal Facebook page designed to solicit a response.


We do a post on our Facebook page and some people respond to it, some people don&#039;t. The ones who respond, we can private message them or whatever and then we can get them on a call and then we can sign them up. Works really well. I know it sounds too simple to really be true will work, but I&#039;m telling you where it is so powerful and it&#039;s so easy to use and I&#039;m going to be sharing screenshots and examples of all of this stuff really soon.


Number two is direct outreach and this is personally emailing a company or a person with a simple message to solicit a response. We could just email someone or you could email a list of people and some of them will respond, some of them won&#039;t. We can take the conversation from there and then work towards getting them on a phone call so we can use our conversion script and then move them into a paying customer. Simple, free, easy-to-use. Everyone has access to these tools.


People can do a Facebook post free, easy. People can send an email free, easy. Number three, lumpy mail and this is ... Lumpy mail is physical direct mail which we send to a company or a person with a message to solicit a response. Lumpy mail is ... I&#039;ll show photos and templates and all the stuff real soon but lumpy mail is basically physical mail sent to someone, but it has an object inside of it so that it is lumpy and what happens is people think that they&#039;ve got something from Amazon or something.


Whenever you get something in the mail and it&#039;s lumpy inside, you get excited. You want to know what&#039;s in it because you think something, someone sent you something interesting, however when you receive flat mail in the ... when you receive flat mail, it&#039;s often bills and boring stuff. That&#039;s why we use lumpy mail and I&#039;m going to share the templates and everything with you soon and then number four, list farming. This is bulk emailing your list if you have one. If you already are in business, this is if you&#039;re already a consultant or if you&#039;re already got your own business, awesome.


There&#039;s a lot of people who come through this program and they&#039;ve already got something going and that&#039;s why I wanted to include this. If you already have a list, the lowest hanging fruit for you to get your first few clients is by just bulk emailing your list and using a message that solicits a response and I&#039;m going to show you what emails to use and how to do it all and everything in this week&#039;s training, but basically we&#039;re emailing them, we&#039;re trying to get them onto a webinar, we get them to a webinar. We do a webinar a particular way and then we get people to schedule a call with us.


There&#039;s a whole sort of process and workflow there and I&#039;m going to share all of those templates and everything with you. If you already have a list by far, this is the low-hanging fruit, you should be going to number four immediately. Number five, the JV webinar and this is ... JV is short for Joint Venture webinar. This is where you partner up with somebody who serves your niche so that they can email their following with a message that solicits a response. Let&#039;s say you were a rabbit and you wanted to get the attention of the zebra.


Well, if a rabbit was really enterprising and smart, it would do a JV with a lion. The lion was able to get attention of the zebra. The rabbit would go to the zebra and the rabbit would go to the lion and the lion would send a message to the zebra and then there would be response. In business, this works really well. What you do is you let&#039;s say you have ... I&#039;ll Andrew Argue as an example.


He&#039;s helping accountants get more customers and grow their firm through understanding sales and all of that. He could go to accounting software companies because accounting software companies have accountants as their customers. He could go to them and say, &quot;Hey look, why don&#039;t we partner up?&quot; Invite people to a webinar.


You can introduce me on the webinar and then I&#039;ll do the webinar. I&#039;ll teach your customers how they can sell and how they can get more clients as an accountant and the JV or the person who you solicit to do this, if they really like what you&#039;ve got to offer, they might say sure and then you might come up with an arrangement to split any sales.


You might go 50-50 or something like that and that&#039;s a really good way to get customers, however these last two, number four and number five, list farming in the JV webinar. These things typically only work for consultants who have been in business for a little bit and list farming, you have to have a list in order to be able to be able to farm it. That one is simple but with the JV webinar, a lot of people aren&#039;t willing to email their entire list or their customer base and risk their reputation with their people unless you have a bit of history behind you.


You&#039;ve got examples of how you&#039;ve helped and you really know your stuff. If that is you at this point in time, awesome. JV webinars and list farming, they are killer strategies to get clients, but if you&#039;re new to this, the organic methods which you&#039;re going to deploy are organic Facebook posts, direct outreach and lumpy mail. That&#039;s what you&#039;re going to use so those are all our organic client attraction methods. We will cover each one in detail and provide step-by-step processes and templates in the organic attraction methods module later in week four&#039;s training.


This is a module two in week four, module three in week four is called organic attraction methods and that&#039;s where we go through each one of those five methods individually and I share the templates and everything. That&#039;s the module where we cover all of that. Now, let&#039;s discuss our second set of client attraction methods and these are paid attraction methods. Paid client attraction methods are highly scalable and automated systems that we use to stimulate our niche market and identify the 3% of people who are ready to buy now. It&#039;s a way to thin the herd and scatter the herd with like in scale.


It&#039;s like a lion and being able to create a ... Well, a smart example of it and nature is really a scarecrow. Instead of the farmer actually being out there and having to run out and scare all the crows. They just use the scarecrow. That&#039;s like a scalable automated system to stimulate that particular species so that the farmer doesn&#039;t have to work so hard and that it can be done in scale because he can&#039;t be there all the time.


That&#039;s basically what we do with paid client attraction methods. Instead of us being the ones which is sending emails or whatever, we can use Facebook ads and Facebook ads are working and they&#039;re going out and getting in front of the market and they&#039;re scattering the herd everyday, all day, all around the world without you doing anything. It&#039;s an automatic and highly scalable way to stimulate our niche market and really thin and scatter that herd. The advantage of using paid methods. Well, they are highly scalable and can attract massive amounts of clients with minimal human labor.


They are automated and run like a machine/system over long periods of time with minimal upkeep and time and put. Like I said with my business, the amount of profit we make and we have like 18 employees, a business that makes ... a typical business that makes as much profit as we do has a thousand employees. One of the ways we do it is by using paid client attraction methods. Instead of having a sales force hitting the phones everyday to sell as much as I do, I would probably have to have 200 sales people just smashing the phones everyday and even then I don&#039;t even know if we&#039;d be able to sell as much as we do.


How do I do that with no sales people? It&#039;s because I deploy these automated attraction methods and that is like Facebook ads and stuff like, they&#039;re very scalable. It means you can scale up and you don&#039;t have to put more people on more seats inside of your company because as you do that, things get complicated, people cost money all of that stuff. You want to run a lean mean business and that&#039;s what using paid methods ... paid client attraction methods allows us to do.


That&#039;s the advantage. The disadvantage of using paid methods. While they are highly scalable and automated, the setup process involves technology in time which means there is a delay in deploying them. They also cost money so while they&#039;re awesome when they&#039;re scaled up, the setup process can be quite big. It can be quite challenging. In order to understand Facebook ads, that&#039;s a bit of work, in order to create Facebook ads and deploy them and then test them and iterate them, that&#039;s a bit of work and in order to build a funnel, write the copy, create the video, set up all the technology, link it all together, track it and everything. It&#039;s work.


When you have to do some work, it means that there&#039;s a delay. There&#039;s a time delay between when you can ... between now and when you can start making money, getting clients, improving your proof of concept which is the most important thing right now and so, this is the downside of paid attraction methods and the other downside is that they cost money. They&#039;re called paid for a reason which means every time someone clicks on our Facebook ad, we&#039;re going to pay Facebook money.


They can be very profitable if your ads are good, but in the beginning stages, we don&#039;t know that much about stuff. It can be Facebook can cost you money so it is important to understand the advantages and the disadvantages. Here&#039;s the ideal use case and application for paid attraction methods. You should use organic methods to get started immediately and land your first few clients and then and only then transition to paid attraction methods once proof of concept is proven and established.


Once you&#039;ve got that proof of concept proven and you&#039;ve really made it strong, you can do that using organic methods once that&#039;s there, you can scale to the hilt with paid attraction methods. That&#039;s the way I grew my business, that&#039;s the way Andrew Argue and all of the other seven-figure students grew their businesses. When I started, I didn&#039;t touch Facebook for a while. I got my clients organically and then only when I was tapping out and I&#039;d heard a ceiling with my ability to do organic methods because they were time-consuming.


Only then did I switch to paid methods and Andrew got ... started making a lot of money and he got his first probably 10, 12 clients without touching paid methods and then only once he had that first 10 to 12 and he had established that proof of concept, then and only then did he move to this in scale and you should do exactly the same with your business.


We have two paid attraction methods that we use to get the attention of our niche market and one process which we use to automatically filter through large groups of people to find the 3% to a most likely to by now. The first two, these are the attraction methods, the paid once. Paid Facebook ads. Number one. These are paid ads to our niche market through Facebook&#039;s advertising platform.


We create an ad which has some text and an image, we put it in front of our niche market and it thins the herd if it&#039;s got a good message and it resonates and it strikes a nerve, it thins the herd, the herd responds and then we are able to start identifying the 3% out of the entire out of the entire population in that niche and then we&#039;re able to to get them to opt in, watch a video, then we&#039;re able to get them to apply for a call, we get on the phone with them, that&#039;s how we do it and it starts with paid ads.


Then number two is paid retargeting ads. These are paid ads to people who have already clicked on our Facebook ads and viewed our website or our high-value video or whatever and then let&#039;s say that they do that and then they leave. Most people click on an ad and then they go to the website and they might even be interested, but then they just leave.


People are frazzled on the internet. Totally normal. Then we have something which are called retargeting ads and these retargeting ads, they know who&#039;s been to our website, it places a cookie in their browser and then it follows them around on the internet wherever they go and it keeps showing our ads to them and it&#039;s like all of a sudden we&#039;re everywhere in this person&#039;s life and it&#039;s like we have omnipresence.


We&#039;re following them around everywhere they go and then they might come back to our website, they start thinking about us more and then eventually they might come back and schedule a call and get on the call and buy with us. The two methods we use to get people into our process and our funnel, paid ads and retargeting ads. Then we have our process which we used to further thin the herd.


Remember that just when the lion stands out in front of the herd, it doesn&#039;t fragment the herd enough. The lion then has to start running and then the herd thins more and more and more and then they end up with a target which they&#039;re able to go for. With paid Facebook ads, it thins the herd a lot. Most people don&#039;t even click on the ad, most people just ignore it.


Some people click on the ad and then don&#039;t do anything, but then some people click on the ad and then they enter their email and they opt in for the video. Once they opt in for that video, it&#039;s still not enough. We need to further filter and we need to further fragment and further scatter that herd. To do this, we use something called a fragmentation funnel.


This is an online funnel process that automatically filters through people and sorts them into different categories depending on their likelihood of buying and this funnel is an automated way of performing natural selection on your niche market to identify the 3% who are most likely to buy now. This is so powerful. I&#039;ve looked at so much biopsychology and all of this stuff and I understand the different actions and the different signals that people give us when they have intent to purchase something.


I understand these drivers so well that I was able to design this thing called the fragmentation funnel and this funnel allows you to pretty much deploy it. We give you the whole templates and everything. Just a couple of clicks of a button to get this thing working for you. I&#039;ve done all of the research and everything. I&#039;ve done all the hard work, it&#039;s real easy for you.


You can deploy this thing and then when you put people into this funnel from Facebook ads or retargeting ads or whatever, this funnel is it further thins the herd and it does so automatically and then all you end up with is people filling out application forms to get on a call with you, you accept some applications, you reject some applications and then you get on the phone with the people who you accept and then when you&#039;re on the phone with them, you do the conversion script which we taught you in week three and you turn them into paying customers.


We&#039;ve really got a full in depth end-to-end system built for you. There isn&#039;t anything which we&#039;ve overlooked in this training program. A lot of other programs, they have a lot of blind spots, they miss areas, but this one is end-to-end and we don&#039;t miss anything. We show you how to start your consulting business, how to optimize it, iterate it, everything. We show you how to get the clients, how to convert the clients when they&#039;re on the phone, the whole thing. This fragmentation funnel is going to be powerful for your business and it&#039;s going to enable you to scale.


We will cover each one in detail and provide step-by-step processes and templates in the paid attraction methods module later in week four&#039;s training which is week four, module four called Paid Attraction Methods. In that video, I show you exactly how we use ads and exactly how we use this fragmentation funnel.


That&#039;s where you&#039;ll find specific information on that and now a word of warning. At this stage of the process, some people get excited about the paid Facebook ads the technology and the funnel. I don&#039;t blame you. It is exciting, but as I warned you in the falling for the trap module which was week four, module one, falling for the trap, I put it as module one for a reason.


You must focus on establishing a strong proof of concept first before moving to paid ads and funnels. It is so important. Paid ads and funnels without a strong proof of concept will not produce any results and all it will do is waste time and money. Don&#039;t fall for the trap and when it comes to attracting clients, nothing is as powerful as natural selection. Natural selection is nature itself. It doesn&#039;t matter what any man builds like nature can tear it apart if it wants to.


It is the most powerful force there is and no technology or anything exists that can really fight its force. When we use the power of natural selection on our side and as our friends to help us segment our niche and also how to really thin the herd and identify those 3%, when we use nature on our side, nothing is as powerful as it. It is one of the most powerful forces that you can use in life and in business to win and to survive and to make sure that you continuously evolve and become the species that has the best traits in it for the way things are moving and the way the environment is changing.


Distribution is never even in nature. I said in the scene for the first time video in week two in the mindset training and the new worldview at the alchemy paradigm and worldview training, distribution is neither normal. It&#039;s why we see 80/20. Things are always skewed and distribution is never even in nature. With these organic and paid client attraction methods, you will be able to identify the 3% of your niche market that is ready to buy so that you can just ignore and forget about the 97% because most people go out and they give 1% of their time to every one person in the market and that ends up totally exhausting them and they end up with nothing.


It&#039;s like the lion that tries to catch 100 zebras. It doesn&#039;t work. It&#039;s silly. You have to use natural selection to scatter the herd and then identify the 3% that you&#039;re going to go after and we use natural selection to do this and he is this pinup again, it&#039;s available for download. It&#039;s a powerful quote and it&#039;s a powerful way to conclude this training module. It says when the facts change, I change my mind.


In nature, life and business, the rules of the game are constantly changing. What serves you at one stage of development might harm you at others and facts and life and business change to and when the facts change, I change my mind. It doesn&#039;t matter how deeply rooted or sacred anything is, when the rules of the game changer are disposed of it and evolved for new conditions.


In nature and business, it&#039;s not the strongest of species that survives, nor the most intelligent, but rather the ones most adaptable to change. As a consultant, you are a driving force in your niche and in your market to helping people in that niche evolve for the changing rules of the game. It doesn&#039;t matter what niche you&#039;re in, the rules are changing all the time and when you start to do research on a niche and when you start to understand it well because you&#039;ve put time into it and you focused, you start to become attuned to the rules and how they&#039;re changing.


A lot of people always ask me how I&#039;ve been able to build such a strong business and such a strong training program and consulting. The truth is is I&#039;ve stuck to my niche for five or six years and I have just been drilling consulting for longer than anyone else. Because I&#039;ve been on consulting and I&#039;ve just been obsessed with it for a very long time and I&#039;ve spent a lot of conscious attention on it, I know the rules of the game and I know when they&#039;re changing.


I can sense all of that stuff, it&#039;s just natural for me to sense now. I&#039;m attuned to everything and I&#039;m able to position myself as the supplier to other participants in the market who need to evolve and it&#039;s like being a zebra who has a service for other zebra about how to not get eaten by lions or it&#039;s like a beetle that has a service that he&#039;s trying to sell to other beetles about how not to get eaten by birds.


That&#039;s basically what I am in the consulting market. The people that don&#039;t have this training program, they will be taken over by the people that do and it&#039;s just the way it works. The people who reject change, the people who ignore the facts when the facts change, they end up getting wiped out and it&#039;s not by anyone else&#039;s doing, it&#039;s by their own doing because the signals are always there when things need to change and you need to be attuned to them and you need to change.


You should think about this quote in two ways. One is evolving yourself. Evolving your behaviors, your actions, your mindset, the way you think, who you hang out with, how you spend your time, all of these things. You should think about how you&#039;re evolving yourself for what you want in the future. That&#039;s one way. The other way is you should think about how you&#039;re evolving your career and your business. How are you evolving your education and your skills?


How are you evolving the technology in your business? How are you staying hid of the market and how are you evolving so you can better serve your customers? Then as a consultant when you&#039;re helping your niche, what are the rules of the game in that niche? How are they changing and how can you really be a provider of information and training and consulting so that you can help your niche evolve and really survive in the new changing conditions?


This is a very powerful quote, it&#039;s available for download below this video which you can just ... in the resources section, you can download it, print it out, put it up on your wall and keep this in mind all the time because it is so powerful. Natural selection is a powerful process for your own development, for your business development and for the development of your clients.


That&#039;s it for this training video. Thank you for watching and I will see you in the next module right now which is module number three where we go over all five of those organic attraction methods and we cover each one in detail, give you the template step-by-step instructions and everything like that. Finish this video, market is done and I will see you in that next training module right now. Thanks.
