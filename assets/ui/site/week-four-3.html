                        Hi everyone, it&#039;s Sam Ovens here and welcome to the third training module in week four which is called Organic Attraction Methods. In this video, I&#039;m going to walk you through the five organic attraction methods that we use to attract clients to our consulting business.

Organic attraction methods are essentially free or close to free methods which we use to generate appointments and generate strategy sessions for our business. Strategy sessions are the phone calls and the sales calls that we have with our perspective clients where we use our conversion script and convert them into paying clients.

Let&#039;s jump right into it and get started.

Here is what we&#039;re going to cover in this training video today. You&#039;re going to see why this video took me a look time to put together because I have provided a ton of resources and templates and information to help you deploy each of these methods. I&#039;m not just going to teach you the theory and the mechanics behind how these different things work. I&#039;m going to give you the templates, all of the funnels, the instructions, and resources, and examples, everything you could possibly need so that you can thoroughly understand each one of these methods and deploy them right away if that is what you want to do at this stage. We&#039;re going to have an in-depth look at all five of these methods.

Now number one is Facebook posts. Number two is direct outreach. Number three is lumpy mail. Number four is list farming and number five is JV webinar. These are our five organic attraction methods and what I&#039;m going to do is walk you through each one and explain it in details. That&#039;s what we&#039;re going to do in this video today.

First of all, we&#039;ll just have a quick brush up on what organic attraction methods are. We discussed this in the previews module, module two in week four, which was all about natural selection and the alchemy of client attraction. That was kind of the theory and the science of everything behind it. If you haven&#039;t watched this video then this one probably won&#039;t make much sense so you definitely want to do that.

Here is our client acquisition methodology from a high level. This is the workflow and the process which we used to get customers. It starts with two main feeding mechanisms, the paid methods and the organic methods. We can use organic methods like the strategies I&#039;m going to show you today to attract interest and get our prospect&#039;s attention or we can use paid methods which I&#039;m going to cover in the next module.

Then, once we get people&#039;s attention then we get our message in front of them, they then come to a landing page, enter in their email and then they watch a value video. A value video is a carefully designed video which gets our message across, it kicks their bruised knee and it shows how we can add value and ask them if they want to solve this problem. Then towards the end it says, if you&#039;re interested in solving this then schedule a strategy session with me and we can have a conversation about that.

Then the next step is for the prospects to complete the survey so they complete that survey and they give us some information about them and their situation and their desires and everything. That enables us to really filter through the applications for calls and make sure that we can extract the tire kickers and filter out the calls which are not a good fit and we are sure are not going to close, which is going to save us time and make us more efficient on the phone.

Then, finally, when we get on the phone with someone it&#039;s when we have approved their survey. We get on the phone with them, we take them through conversion script and then that they either sign up or they don&#039;t. That is our workflow and our methodology for getting clients from start to finish.

Now, in today&#039;s training video, we&#039;re going to discuss the five different organic methods that we use to get the attention of our prospects and our niche, and drive them through into registering for the value video in going through this funnel process.

Most people think that I get all of my clients from paid Facebook ads. That&#039;s what most people think. They think all Sam does is Facebook ads and that&#039;s where he gets his client from and that&#039;s it. That&#039;s not the case at all. Here&#039;s my monthly sales volume by source. Here&#039;s all of my sales divided up by the different lead sources so you can get an accurate picture of this.

Twenty percent comes from list farming which is all these methods I&#039;m going to show in this video today. Twenty percent of my sales come from list farming, 20 from direct outreach, 20 from organic Facebook, and then 40 from paid advertising. What&#039;s interesting about this is that if you add up post three 20s you get 60%. Those three methods that add up to that 60%, those are organic methods. I get 60% of my sales volume from organic methods and 40% from paid.

Sixty percent of my monthly sales volume comes from organic, while only 40% comes from paid, we definitely don&#039;t want to ignore organic methods because that means if there was a million dollars to be made then you would only get 400,000 and you&#039;d leave the other $600,000 on the table if you ignored organic methods.

I know a big mistake a lot of people make coming into this training program and starting their own consulting business is that they think it&#039;s just all about Facebook and they ignore all these other methods and they end up in a bad place because they&#039;re just relying on one source and it&#039;s not good to do that. You want to make sure that you can use organic methods as well as paid methods. In the beginning you want to start with organic methods. Organic methods is how people get their first client.

If you see people posting in the Facebook group about getting their first client, most of those would have come from organic methods. If you see people getting their first client within the first month of being in the program it definitely came from organic methods.

Here&#039;s a brief explanation for organic client attraction methods. Organic attraction methods are free, fast, and easy to use methods that we use in order to stimulate our niche market and identify the 3% who are ready to buy now, which is the 3% is something which we discussed in the previews training module. If you haven&#039;t watched that, make sure you go and watch it now before watching this.

Then, the advantage of using organic methods is that they are fast to set up and deploy, they are easy to understand, they&#039;re low tech, they&#039;re free or close to free to deploy, and they enable you to get moving quickly so that you can get your first client as soon as possible.

The disadvantage of using organic methods is that while they are fast to deploy they require manual labor to do consistently and they become a burden with scale. As we start cranking up the scale of our operations and everything then organic attraction methods can become quite a burden and that&#039;s when paid methods become more preferable because they behave better at scale but at low scale, organic methods behave a lot better than paid methods.

The disadvantage of using â€¦ I&#039;ve already covered that. The ideal use case and application for organic methods, well you should use organic methods to get started immediately and land your first few clients so that you can iterate and establish your proof of concept as quickly as possible. Remember the main goal and main objective right now is to establish that proof of concept. The way you do that is by getting that first client, it all starts with one. The fastest way to get to that first client and the fastest way to get to that proof of concept milestone is by using organic methods and iterating and testing your hypothesis against the market, making iterations, tracking feedback and all of that until you get that first client.

Then once you get that first client, you want to get more. You want to get 5 to 10 clients still using organic methods. Then once you&#039;ve got 5 to 10 clients you know you have a strong proof of concept. That&#039;s when you can start adding massive scale with the paid methods. That&#039;s the recommended process that I tell most people in this training program.

Let&#039;s go through all of the organic attraction methods right now and show you how they work.

Number one is Facebook posts, organic method number one. Here&#039;s an explanation about what Facebook posts are. They are plain and simple. They are so simple it&#039;s not even funny. You use your own personal Facebook profile to friend potential clients. You posts about your success and your client&#039;s success daily. If you can&#039;t post about successes, post stories, questions, insights, tips, and other things specific to your niche and what you are doing.

This is a very powerful method because we&#039;re just going on our own personal Facebook profile, not a business page. We are just posting. We&#039;re doing status updates with our stories of our own success, stories of our client&#039;s success and also, different insights and stories and things like that specific to your niche. What we&#039;re trying to do is we&#039;re trying to add different people as friends who within our niche and who we come across throughout our journey. What happens is when they accept our friend request, they look at our newsfeed and they can see what we do. Then that newsfeed, it&#039;s kind of this mechanism that just stirs the part with your niche.

It starts off slow and it doesn&#039;t get much interest but builds up momentum very quickly. After you&#039;ve been posting success stories and results for like say one month or two months or whatever, people start to notice and they&#039;re like, &quot;I need to talk to this guy.&quot; It&#039;s a very powerful method and it also has a hidden power behind it. That is when people apply for strategy sessions with you, you want to find them on Facebook and add them as a friend before the strategy session. Why we do this is because when you add someone as a friend the first thing they do when they exit your friend request is they look at your timeline and your newsfeed. That&#039;s just the behavior of most people.

When we have our timeline and our newsfeed full of success stories and our client&#039;s success stories and insights into our niche, that means that the prospect who we&#039;re going to have a strategy session call with, they see that and they&#039;re like, &quot;Well, this guy knows what he&#039;s doing,&quot; and it warms the call up before we even get on the call and it acts as a warming mechanism and it&#039;s very powerful.

I highly recommend using this Facebook posts method. It&#039;s a very powerful method to use. It improves your closing percentage on your strategy session calls. It&#039;s also an awesome way to start building up some different connections in your niche and start building a name for yourself. It also gets you into a good habit of posting frequently whether that once a week, once a day or whatever. It forces you into that mode where you have to talk about your niche and stand up and know what you&#039;re talking about. That&#039;s a good thing for most people because most people have never really taken a stand in their niche or never really said anything and it&#039;s a powerful way to build your own confidence up and start building a track record.

This is an excellent way to start sharing your own success, your client&#039;s success and your insights and knowledge so that you can start to build up authority. While this doesn&#039;t sound that great, it&#039;s honestly one of my best performing go-to promotional strategies and it&#039;s completely free.

I will show you what these look like so you know exactly what I&#039;m talking about here. Below this video you will see in the resources section that there are five different PDFs for download. Now for each one of these organic methods I have created a cheat sheet. If we open this one up here, the Facebook post method. This is a PDF which you can download and it&#039;s basically a cheat sheet which gives you a brief explanation about the method and it also provides some resources.

It says, what is it, when should we use it, what are the pros and cons, what&#039;s the process/workflow and then what resources support this method. I can see here there&#039;s a Facebook post swipe file. If I click on this it will open up the swipe file here. This is, you can go and grab this.

Now what I&#039;ve done here is I&#039;ve taken screenshots of different Facebook posts which I have done personally that have worked really well. See you have actual examples of this. You can see that I&#039;m not just talking about this as some sort of theory or nice idea. I mean everything in this program I actually have done and actually have proven in the market with real clients, real money, real everything. Nothing in this program is just some theory, like textbook theory from some academic person. This is street theory. This is theory proven by actually doing it.

For all of these methods I provide you with actual real life examples. You can see here, there&#039;s post from me and I say another client&#039;s success story. This client went from selling $250 101 coaching to high and leveraged group coaching. Then I&#039;m talking about a client&#039;s success story. Here I&#039;m saying another one of my clients making back her investment within three weeks. When your client compares your online program to the 250K Stanford education and he has all of these different posts.

Now I&#039;ve included probably like 6, 70 of this post so there&#039;s a lot of them. I won&#039;t walk through all of them in this training video because you can download this and view this for yourself. Here&#039;s another one of my clients, another client of mine cracking the 100K per month mark. Here is me sharing stories about Andrew Argue.

You can scroll through and you can read the different stories and there&#039;s a lot of them. What you want to do is you want to post business stuff but you also want to post some personal stuff because you don&#039;t just want to look like a robot. You also want to show people a little bit of your personality because that&#039;s one of the elements that helps you differentiate yourself.

You want to be serious and talk about business results, improving your client&#039;s lives and all of that but you also want to share some personal stuff. Maybe it&#039;s some stuff about your family. Maybe you like a particular sport or hobby. Maybe you like playing the guitar or maybe you just share different things about you. You want to mix it up and I would say you want to do about 80% business stuff and then 20% personal stuff. If someone just sees business then it doesn&#039;t really give you much personality so you want to have that 80-20 split there.

You can scroll through these yourself and look at them. There are 60, 70 or more of these screenshots here. Why I&#039;ve given you access to these is you can use these as inspiration. You can use them to spark ideas about what you might post about. Now one thing a lot of people say when they read this is, &quot;Well, Sam, all you post about is your client&#039;s success stories but what if I don&#039;t have any clients yet and what if I don&#039;t have success stories yet?&quot; That&#039;s absolutely fine. I didn&#039;t have client success stories or clients at a stage not too long ago either.

If that&#039;s the case with you, then you just want to talk about insights and stories, you want to ask questions. You don&#039;t need to talk about success stories. You can talk about things like this. Here I see these words change my life three years ago when I stopped trying to force my ideas onto other people in the marketplace. I learned to find the desires in the marketplace and then create products and services that serve those desires, and I took a screenshot of the words which I read.

Here I&#039;m not talking about a success story of mine, of my clients, or of making money or anything. I&#039;m just sharing a little piece of information. If you don&#039;t have client success stories yet then you can post things like that so you can take a look through these and get some ideas and some inspiration from there. You&#039;ve also got this Facebook posts method cheat sheet available for download below this video and that&#039;s where I got the Facebook posts swipe file from.

There are so many different resources in this one module that we&#039;re covering right now. That I created those cheat sheets and then put all the different resources and the individual cheat sheets because otherwise, there would be too many resources listed. It would all be too confusing. I&#039;ve designed this module carefully so that we cover from a high level all five of the methods here and then if you want to really drill down and get into the granular specifics step by steps and all that, then you can grab the cheat sheet and then you can view the specific resources from the cheat sheet.

It&#039;s a way to get a high-level view and then when you know what methods you wanted to use then you can drill down and get the granular detail.

I showed you some examples of this and honestly, Facebook posts have been instrumental when it comes to building my consulting business. I can allocate differently more than $1 million in sales from Facebook posts. Especially when I was a bit smaller, Facebook posts were an awesome method for getting clients.

Here&#039;s the process and the workflow to deploy this attraction method. I&#039;m going to show you step by step how we can deploy this so that you can do it for yourself starting right away.

Number one is you want to start by cleaning up your personal profile and you want to say what you do, clean up your pictures, posts, et cetera, and make your profile look professional but at the same time it should your personality and fun side too. When I say your Facebook profile, I mean your personal Facebook page. If I go to Facebook right now and I go to my profile. This is what it looks like here and it sees â€¦ This is the URL, it&#039;s my personal page. I&#039;m not talking about my business page. I&#039;m talking about my personal page.

This is the page which you want to use to do your post on. You want to put in your intro here, what you do, like I help blank to blank by blank statement. You want to update your profile so that it looks professional. There&#039;re no like stupid photos or anything like that on it. You really want to make it look good but you still want to have a fun side and some personality to it. Once you&#039;ve made it look professional. That&#039;s step one.

Then step two is if you don&#039;t mind posting to your entire friends list on Facebook you should definitely do that. However, if you&#039;re not comfortable doing that you can segment your fiends by creating a list for business people. When you do Facebook post you&#039;re going to open up Facebook and you&#039;re literally going to write the post in here so you would type in like that and then you would just hit post and you will have it set to public.

Now, this is what I recommend. You get more reach and you get more attraction, you get more everything when you post to your entire friends list. Often, there are people in your friends list who know other people who have different problems and a whole network effect starts to take shape. It&#039;s more powerful to do these posts to your friend&#039;s list even if you don&#039;t think there&#039;s anyone on your friend list who is going to be in your niche. It just works better to do it that way.

However, I understand that some people aren&#039;t comfortable doing that because they&#039;ve got friends from college or high school or whatever or they&#039;ve got friends who they&#039;re worried about what their opinions are about what they&#039;re doing, all sorts of personal things. I understand that that&#039;s the case for some people. If you&#039;re not comfortable doing posts to everybody on your friends list then what you can do is you go to home and then you click the see more button and then you can select friends lists here. What you can do is you can create different lists. I&#039;ve got one here called NZ Friends and one here called Business People.

What I do is I put all of the people who are in my niche. I put them into list called Business People and then when you do posts on Facebook you can select to only show it to the business people. What that means is that when you do posts on Facebook no one else is going to be able to see what you&#039;re posting about and everything other than the people that are in this list and it completely separates your friends lists and your network and everything. It&#039;s almost like this invisible Chinese wall that divides all of your posts and information and things like that.

To create a list, you just go Create List. You could call this one whatever and then members. You have to start adding some members to it. What I recommend doing is creating one called â€¦ First of all, I recommend just posting to your whole friends list, it&#039;s way easier, it&#039;s more powerful, it&#039;s going to work better, get you more clients, make you more money. I recommend doing that. If you&#039;re not comfortable doing that then I recommend creating a list. You can create the name of the list, just call it Business People and then what you do is you can go to see all friends and what will this do is it will load up all of your friends here and then you can go through manually one by one and click on each friends.

Here&#039;s Josh Harris. I can go add to another list, Business People then I can go Andrew Argue, add to another list. He&#039;s already in Business People. Paul Organ, I can go add to another list, Business People. I can go through my friends list. My friends list one by one and start adding all of these different people into the business list. I&#039;m basically segmenting my whole friends list.

Now, some of you might have a lot of friends which means that this might take quite a lot of time. It&#039;s still worth it to do. I still sat down and did it with all of my friends which took a long time but it was well worth it because it made me more than a million dollars in sales and it was differently a good use of my time because Facebook posts are powerful.

You definitely want to do it but that&#039;s why I recommend just really posting to your whole friends list because you don&#039;t have to segment it, it that saves your time, and it work better anyway.

You can go through and do all of your segmentation. Then once you&#039;ve done that you have created a friends list and then when you go to your Facebook profile and you go to do a post you can type in whatever your post is and then here you can select public. You can select more and then you can select â€¦ Where is it? Then we can type in the list. It would be Business People. Then it says list here, Business People, I can select that. Go save changes then it says what will these people see after you post.

Now, when I do this post the only people that will be able to see these are people in the Business People list. No one else will be able to see this post, it&#039;s invisible to them. This is a very good way to segment your list and use your personal Facebook profile while still keeping all of your normal friends and your nonbusiness friends and everything and not really putting messages in front of them every single day. That is how you use the Facebook posts method.

Step two, if you don&#039;t mind posting to your entire friends list you can do that or you can create a list. Then step three is to start posting daily about your success, your client success and stories, insight, tips, et cetera. I&#039;ve given you the Facebook posts swipe file as a resource to give you more than 60 or 70 examples of what these look like and how you can create your own.

Then when people start applying for strategy sessions with you, it&#039;s a good idea to friend them on Facebook when they do that before you get on the strategy session call with them. When you friend them on Facebook you want to add them to the Business People list because when you accept them as a friend they&#039;re just going to be a normal friend, you need to put them onto the business persons list so that they can see your timeline of all your results. This will really act as a warming mechanism before the sales call. It will get people seeing photos of you, understanding your business better. Seeing the results you&#039;ve got for your clients and everything, seeing you insights and knowledge when it comes to your niche. Also, it will just build up a lot of trust and authority before the call happens so that when the call comes around your chances of closing the person and getting them to sign up improved exponentially.

To help you deploy the organic Facebook posts method I have included the following resources. The swipe file which is the collection of 50 to 70 posts I&#039;ve personally done. There are additional links and instructions available below this video in the description as well as the cheat sheet.

Like I said, below this video in the resources section you can download the cheat sheet and it has information about the specific method, the process and also additional swipe files and resources.

That is it for the organic method number one, Facebook posts. Don&#039;t underestimate the power of these simple Facebook posts. They are so powerful. I know a lot of people think, &quot;Oh, these are just too simple, as if this is going to make money. This is just doing some posts on Facebook.&quot; I back up everything I do with examples and real life results. Here&#039;s just one example. I see it just a casual conversation between myself and a client that started working with me two weeks ago. Then I talk about their results. Then what happened is somebody messaged me.

You can see the message they sent to me here. They said &quot;All right Sam, let&#039;s talk. Where can I sign up?&quot; We didn&#039;t have a strategy session. I don&#039;t even know who this guy is, but he obviously keeps seeing my posts and keeps seeing my timeline and just was like, all right, I obviously just need to buy whatever this guy has.

That is the power of doing Facebook posts and doing them over time and really building up momentum and a track record. It is very powerful and like I said, just the Facebook posts alone I can attribute to more than a million dollars&#039; worth of sales.

Now let&#039;s discuss organic method number two which is direct outreach. Direct outreach is simply sending a direct email or Facebook message to somebody who you think is a good fit for your consulting services. When you see somebody who is a good fit for what you do, you don&#039;t want to wait until they see your marketing because that might not even happen. People let these everyday opportunities pass by but you need to learn to act when you find somebody who fits the profile of your perfect customer.

If you are just browsing on Facebook or you are in a Facebook group or if you hear a conversation or you meet someone who you believe is a good fit for what you do, then you shouldn&#039;t just ignore that and just leave it because a lot of people just ignore that and think this person will eventually find out who I am and what I do and then they will approach me, but that doesn&#039;t happen. The chances of someone seeing your marketing or hearing about you are quite low. What you want to do is when you come across these people you want to act and you want to tell them what you do and attempt to sign them up as a client.

I know this sounds far too simple to possibly work but direct outreach is a powerful tool that has helped me get some of my best clients which have later turned into my best case studies. When you have a really good case studies, that brings more clients as well. Really, if we look at the cumulative effect of direct outreach when it comes to my business it is huge, but without direct outreach, I wouldn&#039;t be where I am today, plain and simple. Don&#039;t underestimate direct outreach. Just because it&#039;s simple and it sounds really too easy to be true or too easy or too simple to really be effective it is, it is powerful.

Here&#039;s the process and the workflow to deploy this attraction method. Number one, when you see somebody who&#039;s in your niche or you come across somebody whatever way you come across them, when you find someone and you&#039;re like, &quot;This person is a good fit for what I do.&quot; You want to find them on Facebook and you want to add them as a friend there. You want to find them on LinkedIn and you want to add them as a connection there. If you can find them online, if they have website or whatever, try to find their email address and if you can&#039;t find the person&#039;s email, try searching and Google for things like their first name @thecompany.com.

Let&#039;s say I&#039;m looking for Bill Gates I could try Googling <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="07336e6b6b476a6e327533743361732932336a">[email&#160;protected]</a> or <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="bfddd6d3d391d8decbdaccffd2d6dccdd0ccd0d9cb91dcd0d2">[email&#160;protected]</a> or <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="93f1f4f2e7f6e0d3fefaf0e1fce0fcf5e7bdf0fcfebd">[email&#160;protected]</a> You can try these different variations, so <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="2d4b445f5e59434c40442d4e42405d4c4354034e4240">[email&#160;protected]</a> or <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="242e415a5b5c4329454d0324495b5c4329454d334b474554294331032b4745">[email&#160;protected]</a> or first initial last name @microsoft.com. You get the point. You get my point. You want to try different variations of email and when you Google search you&#039;ll be able to see what pops up. When you do this, quite often you can find the person&#039;s email.

Another thing you can do is you can call the phone number on the website and you can just straight up ask for the person&#039;s email. You can fill out the contact form on the website and you can send your direct outreach message that way. Whatever way you use, it doesn&#039;t really matter provided the message gets across to the person we wanted to get to.

If you use email to contact them you should use YesWare to track whether they open the email or not. YesWare is a powerful tool. It&#039;s a Gmail plug-in. If you use Gmail to send your email then you can go to consulting.com/yesware, the link is on the screen. There you will be able to create free account with YesWare. When you have YesWare installed, when you send somebody an email you can click track on the email.

What will happen is when somebody opens that email, it will tell us that they opened the email. It will actually track it which is a very powerful tool because when we&#039;re sending our emails to different people we want to know whether the message gets opened or not. Our open rate is going to be a powerful metric when it comes to knowing whether the messages we&#039;re sending are working or not.

When you&#039;re using email and you&#039;re using direct outreach you want to track this. It will help you evaluate your performance. If you use Facebook to contact them or LinkedIn, you need to add them as a friend first and wait till they accept your friend request before sending them a message, otherwise, it will go to spam. If I was just to find some random person on Facebook and send them a private message, the message wouldn&#039;t get delivered. I&#039;m not joking, it doesn&#039;t get delivered. It just goes to spam. The person will never see it. They won&#039;t even know that you reached out. It&#039;s very important that you add them as a friend first. Add them as a friend, wait until they accept your request, when they accept your request then you can send your message. In that way, it is guaranteed to get delivered and they will see it.

The same goes with LinkedIn. You want to add them as a connection first and then send them the message on LinkedIn. When you&#039;re using email you want to use YesWare to track it. These different methods here ensure that your message gets delivered and it enables you to really know with some sort of confidence that your messages are getting to your prospect and they&#039;re not getting lost somewhere in the process.

Then step number three is simply to send the message using the provided templates as guidance. I&#039;ve created some resources for you and a template for you when it comes to direct outreach so that you can see how it&#039;s done and get an idea and everything.

Beneath this video in the resources section, you&#039;ll be able to see the direct outreach method cheat sheet. You can download that PDF and it looks like this and it says direct outreach method, what is it, when we should we use it, what are its pros and cons, what&#039;s the process/workflow and what resources support this method.

Here I can see there&#039;s a direct outreach template and I just click available here and it will open this up. Here it says here&#039;s the template. There&#039;re some tips at the top to improve performance. You want to personally write each message, don&#039;t just copy paste the template.

People are smart enough to know if something&#039;s just a template email. If you just send people template stuff they filter it. Humans evolved enough to understand what spam and what&#039;s template and what&#039;s actually genuine. That&#039;s pretty much every human knows how to do that. You don&#039;t just want to copy paste stuff and you don&#039;t just want to use the same template again and again because you won&#039;t get very good results with it.

I provided this template as a guideline but not as a word for word thing that you&#039;re going to copy and paste. You want to make sure that you personally write each message. Take the time to write it personally and you will see the results. You want to personally send each message from your own email. Don&#039;t broadcast it using a software.

Some people I notice they get Mailchimp or Aweber or one of these email systems and they import a massive list in there of a few hundred people or a few thousand people and then they just send one big broadcast out to everyone. You don&#039;t want to do this. You want to send these emails like you would send an email to your friend or your family or something like that. Number one is it will get delivered with the higher probability. Number two is it won&#039;t go to their junk or promotions folder. Number three is that it won&#039;t have unsubscribed link at the bottom which shows that it was actually mailed by real person.

Also, people can just tell. People can tell when something is a broadcast or if it&#039;s genuine. You want to personally write each message and personally send each message. You just want to use your Gmail account. You want to go into your own Gmail and just send it from there. Just type it up and hit send.

You can use YesWare to track whether people open and read your emails. To get that you go to consulting.com/yesware and only seeing Facebook and LinkedIn messages once your frienddid/connected to ensure deliver. Those are some quick tips.

Now here&#039;s the message. The subject lineup used here is NAME - 2-5xResults? This could be Bob - 2-5xResults? It&#039;s basically we put their name in there to get their attention and then we talk about growth improving results and then question mark which piques their curiosity. Now all the subject line is really trying to do is get the person&#039;s attention first and foremost and second, get them to open the email. This subject line does a good job when it comes to this.

However, you might want to personalize this or customize it depending on your niche, your offer, and all of that.

Then it says Hey NAME so it might say Hey Bob, I see that you are in the XXX space. This could say, I see that you are in the plumbing space or plumbing industry and are doing some awesome things. My area of expertise is helping XX by X. This is helping blank to blank by blank. I could say my area of expertise is helping plumbers to get hot water cylinder customers through digital marketing. Then I could say, I have taken a look at what you&#039;re doing and have some things I&#039;d love to show you which I&#039;m sure will boost your results.

If you have case studies then you can talk about one to three of them here. It says 13 but it should say 1-3, so one to three of them. If you don&#039;t have any case studies, don&#039;t worry, you don&#039;t need them here. Then I say, when suits for a quick 15-minute chat? Then I sight off with my name, so I just write Sam and then I&#039;d include your phone number and a link to your LinkedIn or something into the footer.

Why we do this is it just makes it a little bit more personal and a little bit more serious. When we send emails just from an email address that doesn&#039;t really have any link to any place where someone can find out more information about us, people are a little bit skeptical. Put your phone number there, put you your LinkedIn profile there, and it just shows people that you&#039;re serious and that you&#039;re not trying to hide from anything. You&#039;re the real deal and all of that.

That is the template which I provided you with for using direct outreach. Now, if you&#039;re going to reach out someone on Facebook you could say something similar to this, so you wouldn&#039;t sign it off with your name and phone number and everything because that&#039;s not what people do on Facebook. You also don&#039;t put a subject line for a message on Facebook. You just use it like this. You&#039;d use the stuff here and you&#039;d send that out as a message to the person on Facebook.

If you use LinkedIn, same rules apply. The same template would work for email direct outreach, LinkedIn direct outreach, and Facebook direct outreach. Their message really stays the same. It&#039;s just the channel that has some variance in it.

In this cheat sheet here, I&#039;ve got the direct outreach template, the YesWare link and also, you can find out more from the program content which is what we&#039;re covering right now.

That&#039;s the workflow and the process for deploying this method. To help you deploy this method I&#039;ve got these resources which I&#039;ve already covered. Here&#039;s when you should use direct outreach. This is a bit of an explanation about when direct outreach is a good fit for you and your business.

If you find somebody who&#039;s a perfect fit for what you do, send them an email Facebook or LinkedIn message. If you don&#039;t have huge money to spend on Facebook ads which â€¦ When I say this, I mean less than $100 a day. If you&#039;re not spending $100 a day on Facebook ads then you need to use direct outreach and other organic methods. Because Facebook only becomes a big enough engine on its own to feed you with enough leads when you&#039;re spending more than a hundred a day. Even when I was spending 500 a day or more I would still do organic methods and I&#039;d still do direct outreach.

Don&#039;t fall victim to this one. If you&#039;re spending less than that, make sure you&#039;re doing at least five to ten direct outreach messages every single day. You want to make this an ingrained habit of yours. Every day you want to wake up, pull up Google, start searching from some different people who you believe are a good fit for your services. Make a list of them and then send them an email or send them a message on Facebook.

Every single day just chip at it like just grind on it and you&#039;ll start to build up momentum and you&#039;ll be surprised at how many clients come your way once you&#039;ve done this for a period of say, 30 days or more and you built up some momentum. Things will really start to happen for you.

Me personally, I still do one to two to direct outreach emails and messages every single day even though I have huge momentum and advertise on Facebook 24/7, 333. Even though I&#039;m in the place now where I spend such an obscene amount of money on Facebook ads and I have so much people drawn to my business, I still make an effort to use direct outreach. That really goes to show how powerful this method is.

The bottom line is direct outreach works. Don&#039;t fall victim to relying on Facebook ads only and make sure you&#039;re doing one to ten or five to ten direct outreach messages every single day as well. It&#039;s a habit that will really serve you and really help you to get clients and make a lot of money.

Once again, I said don&#039;t underestimate the power of it. Here are just some of the clients which I&#039;ve been able to get through direct outreach. Chris Evans and Taylor Welch, I reached out to them on Facebook and said, &quot;Hey, I think I can help you guys out,&quot; and we started talking then they signed up and we do the strategy session, they signed up. I helped them grow from 20 grand a month to 300 grand a month. I really helped them explode their business. From doing that, I&#039;ve been able to get a lot of other clients from having this case study.

If we are to look at how powerful this is, we can&#039;t just look at the client I got. We have to look at the clients I got from being able to have that client. This wouldn&#039;t have been possible if I don&#039;t use direct outreach. If I didn&#039;t reach out to Chris and Taylor they may have never signed up with me and my business may never have helped their business and they might not be where I am today. My business certainly wouldn&#039;t be where is today.

Then here&#039;s Andrew Argue so I used direct outreach for him as well. I reached out to him and using email and Facebook. Then we&#039;ve got on a strategy session, he signed up and everything. When he first started working with me he was making 17 grand a month. Now he&#039;s at $500,000 a month which is obscene. It&#039;s a huge growth curve and this happened in about a year and a half.

Both of these examples here, they were generated from direct outreach. Don&#039;t discount and think all this is just too simple to work, this won&#039;t be a good one, I&#039;m sure there&#039;re better methods that Sam has. This direct outreach is responsible in a big way for growing my business and getting it to where it is today so don&#039;t discount it or forget about it.

Now let&#039;s talk about organic method number three which is lumpy mail. Lumpy mail is physical postal mail that you send to people you believe are a good fit for your consulting services, but it has a unique twist. A unique twist is that it&#039;s lumpy and I&#039;ll explain this. There I&#039;ve got some images of some old direct lumpy mail packages which I sent out to people.

You can see here lumpy mail is just a normal two-page letter which we print out. Then we put it in a bag to send to someone through the post. What makes it different is that it&#039;s lumpy. It&#039;s lumpy because we put a physical object inside of it. In this image on the left I have a magnifying glass. That&#039;s what I put in there to make it lumpy. On the image on right I put a little trashcan with $100 note hanging out of it and that&#039;s what made that one lumpy.

Now, why we make it lumpy is because it stands out and it gets attention, it&#039;s different. When you send mail to people they typically don&#039;t open just the normal letters because it&#039;s bills, it&#039;s boring stuff, or anything like that. When people get a lumpy package it&#039;s kind of exciting. You think you&#039;ve got something from Amazon. You think you&#039;ve got â€¦ it&#039;s one of the products or whatever that you purchased online. It&#039;s exciting when you see one and so you want to open it.

Also, lumpy mail has a tendency to get pass gatekeepers. If there&#039;s a receptionist that checks the boss&#039;s mail at the business, what they will typically do is they will have an A pile and a B pile and when they&#039;re filtering through all of the incoming mail, any bills or anything like that, the receptionist will pull into one pile. However, if anything looks personal or if anything looks like it is something that the business owner purchased himself, they will sort that into a different pile and they won&#039;t open it because they want to give that directly to the business owner.

It has a way of getting past gatekeepers, because if you send a normal letter to a business owner, the gatekeeper will probably filter that message and it won&#039;t ever get to him or her. However, a lumpy message has a much higher chance of getting to the business owner and getting opened and getting read. Also, lumpy mail has a tendency to stay at the top of the mail pile. If the receptionist or the gatekeeper or assistant places the mail pile on the business owner&#039;s desk, a lumpy package can&#039;t sit at the bottom. Because if you sit a lumpy package at the bottom and then you put mail on top of it, all the mail falls off. It naturally finds its way to the top of the pile.

We&#039;ve got this message here which is very powerful one, because it&#039;s different; two, because it gets the recipient excited. When they receive it they want to open it. Three is it gets past the gatekeeper. Four, it makes its way to the top of the mail pile. The result of all of these things is that we have a very powerful and a very simple method for getting our message in front of our prospects.

What we do is we create a letter. You can read the headline on this one on the left that says, &quot;Simon - People Looking for Your Services Are Going to Need More Than a Magnifying to Find Your Business.&quot; We have a headline and then we have the letter and everything, and then we send it to them. Now, it&#039;s very important that the lumpy mail object like the magnifying glass or the trashcan has some relevance to the letter that we&#039;re sending them. You don&#039;t just include a random object in there because people would be like why did he do this, but you get away with it when you tie it in it through the theme of your letter.

On this one on the left here I&#039;m saying people looking for your services are going to need more than a magnifying glass to find your business. I&#039;m basically saying when people go looking for you, they can&#039;t find you and even if they were to use a magnifying glass they still can&#039;t find you. It&#039;s a cheeky way of making my point as well as putting a physical object in there.

Then the one on the right, the headline says Plumb Quick - You&#039;re Throwing Money in the Bin by Making These Critical Mistakes with Your Digital Marketing. I&#039;ve got $100 note in a little trashcan. Again, it&#039;s tied into the central theme of my mailing piece. The trashcan ties into the headline, it ties into my message and so that&#039;s how I make the message more powerful. It&#039;s also how I get away with being able to put physical objects in these mailing packages and be able to use this method because when the business owner opens it they think that&#039;s smart or cunning. It puts you in a good position for landing that person as a client because you&#039;re already getting their attention. You&#039;re already standing out and differentiating yourself.

In the modern internet age, most people don&#039;t use physical mail and this makes it an easy channel to get attention with since it&#039;s less crowded. In the modern day, most people use internet, email, all of that stuff. What that means is that people have moved away from physical mail and because people have moved away from that, there&#039;re less messages to compete with inside the mail box because there&#039;s less people using the mail box as a means to get their message in front of people. It&#039;s actually a very good strategy to use. It&#039;s very powerful.

Lumpy mail has the following advantages. We can pinpoint exactly who we want to target and get a message in front of them. We can research the person who we want to target and find the exact person and target them. When it comes to some other methods like Facebook ads and things, we&#039;re targeting a large pool of people. It&#039;s not laser targeted.

Lumpy mail feel personal and it gets past gatekeepers, which I&#039;ve already told you about, and it gets into the boss&#039;s private mail pile. Lumpy mail can&#039;t sit at the bottom of the mail pile because things will fall off it, so naturally it finds its way to the top and gets opened.

Another cunning strategy we can use when sending lumpy mail to people is to handwrite the address on it. We don&#039;t want to just stick a label on it. We want to use blue ink and we want to write the person&#039;s name and their business address and everything because it looks more personal. It will get past the gatekeepers, it has a higher chance of getting opened because it looks like a friend or family member sent something.

Then when it comes to the sender&#039;s address on the back of the package, a very cunning strategy we can use is to just put a woman&#039;s first name if you&#039;re mailing it to a man. Why we do this is because if we don&#039;t put the address in the sender&#039;s details and all we put is a first name and not a last name it looks like well, this is definitely personal and especially if it&#039;s blue ink and it&#039;s from a woman&#039;s first name and it&#039;s a lumpy package and it looks very personal. What happens is the psychology behind it is the gatekeeper sees this mail, sees a woman&#039;s first name on it and no sender&#039;s address, no last name or anything. They immediately think oh, I better not open this because I might be intruding if I look in here. It might be something very personal. It might be dangerous for me to look in here.

What they do is they&#039;re like it&#039;s not worth the risk of me looking so I&#039;m just going to hand it directly to the business owners. It&#039;s a very cunning method to get the message in front of the business owner and get it read and bypass the gatekeeper completely. Just use a woman&#039;s first name on the sender&#039;s details. Blue ink even works better than black ink.

Different companies have tested this stuff. These different companies that have sent millions of packages to people and they&#039;ve tested the color of the ink and everything. Blue ink gets opened more when you write the sender&#039;s details and the shipping address and all of that on the package.

There&#039;re some images of these packages I&#039;ve sent out. Like all of these methods, I personally use this. I created these templates from scratch. I found these different physical objects to use in these. I sent these out to more business owners than I can think of and I&#039;ve used this method to start and grow my business.

Back in the early days, lumpy mail was my main weapon when it came to getting customers and it&#039;s responsible for landing me a lot of clients and making me a lot of money.

Here&#039;s the process and the workflow to deploy this attraction method. Step one, you can search for people in your niche using Google and build up a list of potential clients using Google Docs or Microsoft Excel.

What you want to do is first of all, you need to have a list of people so that you can send some lumpy mail to them. One thing you can do is just go to Google and search. You can search for, let&#039;s say, I live in Sydney, in Australia and my niche is plumbers. I could search for plumbers Sydney and then I would Google and come up with the results. I could just start scrolling through and start finding different websites and checking them out and then if they look like they were a good fit then I could add them to a Google Doc or Microsoft Excel file and start building a list that way.

Then once you&#039;ve got a list of people that you want to send lumpy mail to then you can start sending it to them. I&#039;m not going to go into depth about how to build up a list because I covered this in detail in the module called Planning Your 30D Attack and this stands for 30-day attack.

This is a module and it&#039;s in week four after this one. If you want to know more about building a list, check that module out for more information on how to do that.

Then you want to use one of our lumpy mail templates or create one yourself. I&#039;ve provided you with these lumpy mail templates which I personally use. You can download the lumpy mail method cheat sheet which is in the resource section below this video. It&#039;s a PDF, looks like this. It basically says what is it, when should we use it, what are its pros and cons, what&#039;s the process/workflow, and what resources support this method. I&#039;ve included a ton of resources here.

If you want the trashcan template which was the one I showed you, the trashcan with the $100 note out of it, you can click on word to get a Microsoft Word file or gdoc to get a Google doc file. I&#039;ll click on this one. Here I get the template for this specific lumpy mail method. I can walk you through this one right now.

It says Plumb Quick - You&#039;re Throwing Money in the Bin by Making These Critical Mistakes with Your Digital Marketing. Then I put a screenshot of the front page of the website. Why I do this is because it&#039;s personalization. When someone sees their name in the headline or their company name and then they see a screenshot of their company, we&#039;ve got their attention because it&#039;s personal.

Then I say Plumb Quick, I visited your website through one of your Google ads and noticed some critical mistakes that are costing you money and losing your customers to the competition. Making these mistakes is no different to actually throwing your money in the bin. Turn the page and I&#039;ll explain how. This is a powerful message because remember, I&#039;m combining it with this trashcan here which you can see on the screen and I&#039;ve send it to them. I&#039;m saying, &quot;You&#039;re throwing money in the bin.&quot;

At this stage, I&#039;ve really created desire and I&#039;ve got their attention and I&#039;ve also started to kick their bruised knee a little bit by saying that they&#039;re making some critical mistakes, they&#039;re losing customers to the competition. I&#039;m creating that agitation, that pain there.

At this point, the person wants to know what I&#039;ve got to say. Turn the page and I&#039;ll explain how. Then I say, &quot;Dear Plumb Quick, please forgive the forwardness of this letter. But I can imagine as a business owner, you would like to be told directly about things like these. Right now, you are spending money on Google AdWords and there are some critical mistakes with your campaign that are costing you money and losing you customers to the competition.&quot; Here, I&#039;m basically just saying, I&#039;m basically intro-ing the letter. I&#039;m saying, please forgive the forwardness but this is serious, this is why I needed to tell you this way. Then the problem that you&#039;re making is to do with this one specific area of your business.

If you&#039;re in another niche which isn&#039;t digital marketing and you&#039;re not selling to plumbers or anything like that, it doesn&#039;t matter. You can still use lumpy mail. What you want to do is look at how I&#039;ve used lumpy mail and then come up with your own ideas. Think about what&#039;s an object which you could put in in a mailer and use to mail to business owners so that you could get their attention and really get your message across. You don&#039;t have to use my templates. You don&#039;t have to use this here. I&#039;ve provided it so that you can use it word for word if you want. However, I&#039;ve provided it more so that you can get ideas and create your own variations.

Then I cut to the problem. Here&#039;s the problem. Right now, all of your advertising is driving traffic to your website&#039;s homepage and this is one of the biggest nos in advertising. People who search for a term like &quot;Plumbers Auckland&quot; click on an ad that says Plumbers Auckland and then they expect to land on a page that says Plumbers Auckland. However, you&#039;re dropping them onto your homepage. At this stage, when I was using lumpy mail, I was helping people out with Google AdWords and digital marketing and things like that so that&#039;s why I&#039;m using this specific example.

When people land on this page, they don&#039;t get what they thought they were going to get and they hit the back button to go to the next offer which will be one of your competitors, this is costing you money and you really need to fix this. By telling them the problem, I&#039;ve really kicked their bruised knee and now they&#039;re feeling like they needed to fix this. Then I say, &quot;Here&#039;s how to fix this.&quot; I&#039;ve created a video just for you showing you in person the mistakes that you&#039;re making and how you can fix them. Jump onto your computer right now and go to this link, then I have a link which is personalized so I personalized it to have the person&#039;s last name or the company&#039;s name at the end of the link.

By doing this, it&#039;s enticing. People want to go to the link because it&#039;s got their name in it. Then I say, in this quick video, I walk you through these mistakes and show you how to fix them so make sure you go check that out now and then I signed it off with my name digital marketer, whatever we want to say, my phone number and then I like to put an image of myself, a head hot. Putting the headshot in here shows that you&#039;re not afraid to show your face, you&#039;re not afraid to hide behind anything. Also, it personalizes the message as well.

If I go to this right here, this URL, we can see what this looks like. We basically say, Plumb Quick, here&#039;s some critical mistakes which you&#039;re making with your digital marketing. Step one, watch this video which I made for you. In this video, I basically say here&#039;s all these mistakes that you&#039;re making and I personally walk through a screen recording of the website and tell them all of the different mistakes. By doing this, I&#039;m showing that I&#039;m different than the other marketers. I don&#039;t just send out spam. I take the time to personally send things like this. Also, it&#039;s different. No one else has ever sent anyone anything like this.

Third, I&#039;m really showing my commitment to delivering value and helping the business before the relationships really even started. They watch this. I won&#039;t walk you through the whole video because it&#039;s five minutes and you can go and watch it yourself by going this page. What happens is they watch this video and then if they&#039;re interested, they schedule a free consultation with us to discuss. Here, you can see there&#039;s a calendar and they&#039;re able to go through here and select a time and date. This syncs with our Google calendar so that it&#039;s always showing the right availability. Then it asks them for the information and they go through and they fill all that out and they schedule a call with us.

That&#039;s the first template which is the trashcan template. Now, I&#039;m going to show you soon in this video how to set up the landing pages and how to set up this thing here which is just showed you on the internet but for right now, I&#039;m just going to walk you through the templates, the letters first and then I&#039;ll get to the digital stuff in just a moment. There&#039;s the trashcan template. There&#039;s also the magnifying glass template. If I click on gdoc here, I can open this up. Here&#039;s the template for the magnifying glass mailer. If I go back here, the magnifying glass mailer, you can see is this one. It says Simon, people looking for your services are going to need more than a magnifying glass. The template goes Simon, people looking for your services are going to need more than a magnifying glass to find your business, then I say Simon, last month, 43,600 people searched for terms like Plumbers Auckland in Google and you were no place to be found.

Here&#039;s what the search results look like right now. I did a Google search for Plumbers Auckland and I took a screenshot of what the search results look like. Then this 43,600 number, you want to find out how many people are searching for plumbers each month in your particular area if that&#039;s what you are doing. Now, this is just a random number which I made up for this template. If you&#039;re going to use this exact template, you want to find out the specific number of people that is searching. What I&#039;m basically trying to achieve here on this first page of the letter is I&#039;m using their first name to get their attention and show personalization.

Then I&#039;m saying that people looking for your services are going to need more than a magnifying glass to find you. In a cunning way, I&#039;m getting their attention and I&#039;m telling them that they&#039;re making a mistake. I&#039;m really enforcing my message and reinforcing my message with the lumpy mail magnifying glass which I include. Then I back it up more with the statistic and with a screenshot of what Google search actually looks like. Then I say, as I see it, even with the magnifying glass, your business can&#039;t be found. Then I go to the next page. Now, at this stage, I have got their attention. They&#039;re alert. They&#039;re ready to hear what I&#039;ve got to say and they&#039;re starting to feel a little bit of agitation because I started to kick their bruised knee.

Dear Simon, please forgive the forwardness of this letter but I can imagine as a business owner, you would like to be told directly about things like this. You see, last month, over 43,600 people searched for terms like Plumbers Auckland online. These are people who have a problem and are in need of your services. They&#039;re literally hot and ready to buy but. Here, I&#039;m saying that, forgive the forwardness but this is a serious matter. There&#039;s a large number of people searching but you&#039;re not anywhere to be found and this is a big problem. Then I come in and explain more about the problem.

Your business doesn&#039;t appear anywhere for these searched terms. Look at the screenshot on the front page, your business is nowhere to be found. That means that all of these business and all of this money is going to your competitors and you&#039;re missing out big time. Here, I&#039;m really just kicking that bruised knee more. I&#039;m establishing a pain point. Then I&#039;m saying, but it doesn&#039;t have to be this way. There are ways to get your business on page one of Google immediately and in front of all these searching customers. I&#039;ve had a look at the competition and I&#039;m confident that we can get you results fast.

Results that get your business appearing up the top of Google and results that get your phone ringing with ready to buy customers. Here I&#039;m saying there is solution and I could help you with it. Here&#039;s what I recommend. I&#039;d like to offer you a free consultation where I&#039;ll walk you through exactly what to do to get your business appearing in Google immediately. I&#039;ll outline all the necessary steps and at the end of this consultation, you can take the information away and implement it yourself or hire somebody else to implement it for you. There are absolutely no obligations to choose me or my services unless you choose to.

I&#039;m just basically reversing the risk here. I&#039;m saying you&#039;ve got nothing to lose by doing this and everything to gain. It&#039;s a risk reversal. Then I&#039;m saying, to book a consultation, please call this phone number and I&#039;d put my phone number here or email me and I&#039;d put my email in here. Then I&#039;m saying thanks, my name and then digital marketing consultant. I&#039;d also put a little headshot profile picture of you in here as well, any form of personalization makes it more powerful. That is the magnifying glass lumpy mail template.

Again, if you&#039;re in the digital marketing niche, you can use this as exactly how I have done it here. However, if you&#039;re in a different niche, you can use this as inspiration and as a framework for creating your own. It doesn&#039;t matter what you&#039;re selling, whether it&#039;s personal training or anything. You could create one of these for yourself. Now, to tell you just some examples of how other people have done this, I remember we had a photographer in our program and they wanted to get the attention of different galleries around America and they were trying to think, well, what could be a good lumpy mail item to include in the package to get the attention of these galleries.

They decided to find like a plastic foot. They found a little plastic foot which you could buy online and only cost a couple of bucks. They put that in the package and they said the person&#039;s name, I&#039;m just trying to put my foot in the door or get a foot in the door. It was a way of kind of saying, hey, I try to get a little bit of attention so I can explain something to you and I&#039;m being humble about it and they even put a foot in there which was really cunning and it worked really well. There&#039;s infinite possibilities when it comes to using lumpy mail. Just because I provided these two templates, the trashcan one and the magnifying glass one doesn&#039;t mean you have to use these.

You can create your own. You can create variations of these. It doesn&#039;t matter what niche you&#039;re in, doesn&#039;t matter what services or offer that you are offering, you can come up with something unique that fits for your application. Those are the two templates. Now, there are also sites to buy lumpy items from. Those are the products or the physical objects which we put inside the packages. I&#039;ve got two options here for you so you can click on option number one. To go to this one, you could go to consulting.com/3dmail. This one here you could click on products and you can see all of the different products which they provide and you can buy in order to send lumpy mail items.

You can scroll through these and really look at all the different things that are available and try and get some ideas about what you might send. Here&#039;s one that say, this one is a pill bottle. You could mail it. If someone was having stress issues in their business, you could email them this and say, &quot;Take this aspirin and sit down and read this letter.&quot; You could talk about how the stress is killing them and they need to fix that. There&#039;s all sort of different ones. There&#039;s Rubik&#039;s cubes, boomerangs, dice, all sorts of different things. Here&#039;s the Foot in the Door one which I was talking about. All sorts of different stuff and you can scroll through here, take a look for yourself to get ideas and inspiration about what to send.

This one is consulting.com/3dmail to go to this provider. Then there&#039;s another provider and it is consulting.com/lumpymail and here is another provider and you can click on products and look at what they send. They&#039;ve got trashcans, bank bags, silver platter. You could say, I&#039;m sending this to you on a silver platter or different things, message in a bottle, all sorts of different ideas. Now, I&#039;ve provided you with those two resources to buy lumpy mail products from, however, you can buy them from anywhere. You could look on Amazon, eBay. You could look on Google. You can buy them from anywhere, however, I&#039;ve just provided you with these two options here as an example.

I&#039;ve personally purchased things from both of these stores and use them and had good results with them. Now, a common problem people have or question people have is when they&#039;re not in America. If you don&#039;t live in the United States and you go to these websites, you&#039;ll notice that they don&#039;t ship outside of America and so most people were like, &quot;Oh I can&#039;t use this service.&quot; Well, I&#039;ve got something pretty cool to show you. When I lived in New Zealand for a long time so I&#039;ve lived in New Zealand my whole life pretty much, I&#039;ve only been in America for a little amount of time so I know how to get around to all of the stuff.

There is a site which you can use for forwarding mail from the USA into any country around the whole world. What basically happens is they give you a virtual mailbox which is a special mailbox that you can put on your shipping address information. You can buy stuff from Amazon and you can buy stuff from these lumpy mail shops. You can buy stuff from anywhere in America even if they only ship to America. Then you put the shipping address as your virtual shipping address. Then the company will ship it to the virtual address and then at the virtual address, these are these big factories and they sort all of the mail and then they redirect it and send it to you anywhere in the world.

I used it a lot. I used it all the time. The site I recommend is called Shipito. To go there, you go to consulting.com/shipito. It&#039;s consulting.com/shipito. There&#039;s a link to go there if you click here. Here&#039;s the site. It says, sign up and get your Shipito address, shop anywhere and it will ship to this US address and then you can combine all of your different packages and everything into one and then they will send it to you anywhere in the world. I&#039;ve used this thing more than I can possibly explain. Because when I lived in New Zealand, I mean, I would spend â€¦ everything I bought on Amazon and everything got forwarded to this shipper and then they would ship it to me in New Zealand.

It&#039;s actually cheaper to do it that way than to ship it directly from Amazon to your personal address. It&#039;s a very powerful method to use if you don&#039;t live in the United States. That&#039;s how you can get around that one, consulting.com/shipito. Then you will have noticed that in the first lumpy mail template which I&#039;ve showed you which was the trashcan mailer, at the end of it, I directed the prospect to a link to go online and view a video and schedule an appointment and everything. You&#039;re probably wondering, well how do we set that up? Just to refresh your memory real quick, if I pull up this trashcan template, scroll down to the bottom, there&#039;s a link here and it says to go to this URL.

Well, I&#039;ve created all the templates and instructions and everything so that you can set all of this up for yourself and to do that, you just go here and it says, landing page templates and scheduling system available here. To do that, you go to â€¦ where&#039;s the links? You can go to consulting.com/clickfunnels. Consulting.com/clickfunnels, that is the URL. When you go to that, you will basically, this one here is going to link through to this. It&#039;s going to take me to a page that looks like this. What I&#039;ve basically done is I&#039;ve partnered with a company called ClickFunnels. We&#039;ve teamed together to bring you all of the technology, the landing page templates and everything that you could possibly need for you consulting business ready to be installed with one click.

Normally, it would take you a lot of money and a lot of time and a lot of resources to go out and build all of the stuff. I can&#039;t really explain how long it would take you. You also have to deal with technology, all of this technical stuff. We&#039;ve made it so easy that you can just install this with a click. You go to consulting.com/clickfunnels then you click on install your funnels so I&#039;m just going to quickly open this up in this window here so that it doesn&#039;t have my original history on it. What you want to do is go to consulting.com/clickfunnels, click on install your funnels.

Now, if you&#039;re an existing ClickFunnels costumer, if you currently have a ClickFunnels account and you&#039;re using ClickFunnels, then you would select yes I do. If you don&#039;t, you&#039;d select no I don&#039;t. If you select no I don&#039;t, you&#039;re going to set up a free trial so it would create a new account. You&#039;d come here, start your free trial, you&#039;d fill this out and you would â€¦ I&#039;ll show you real quick how that would go. You would type in your information. Then it would take you to this page here. On this page here, you want to put in your full name, email, password, mobile phone, click create my account. It will create you a free trial of ClickFunnels. Then after you&#039;ve created your free trial, check your email.

You will have an email from me which has the link to import and download all of our funnels into your new account. That&#039;s what you do if you don&#039;t have an account. You want to create one by clicking no I don&#039;t following that process there. If you do have a ClickFunnels account, then we don&#039;t need to create you a new one. We don&#039;t need to create you a new free trial. You can just select yes I do. Then it will take you to this page and it says, install our templates into your ClickFunnels. Load our website and funnel templates directly into your existing ClickFunnels account.

You put in your information and you click on install my templates. Then here, you can see all of the different templates which I have created for you and made available to import with one click. I provided you with a full blow in consulting website. When people start their own consulting businesses, having a website is generally quite an obstacle. It&#039;s hard to set up. You got to deal with different technical people, all these different softwares and platforms that are confusing, technical language. It&#039;s confusing. I get it. I was there personally myself not too long ago.

What I&#039;ve done is I&#039;ve designed and created the very simple but very powerful consulting website for you to use. You can just install it with a click and edit the information and it&#039;s yours. To view a demo of it, you can click here to view live demo. The URL is samovensdemo.com that is where this website is staged right now. You can get a real life experience of what it&#039;s like. At the top, we&#039;ve got our name as the logo, very simple. Then we have about contact blog and free case study. Those are the main [inaudible 01:23:22] items and then it says, this is where you put your I help blank to blank by blank statement. Then I&#039;ve got a small little paragraph about me, what I do, one simple image of me, copyright information and then we&#039;ve got privacy policy in terms.

Now, I&#039;ve created this page, this website for you because it&#039;s very simple. I mean, it looks good. It&#039;s really simple which means it&#039;s fast to set up. You don&#039;t need to play around with designs or anything. All you do is you just change my information for yours. You&#039;d put your name here. You&#039;d put your statement here. You&#039;d put your sentences here. You&#039;d put an image of you here. You&#039;d change this information down here to be your own and bam, you&#039;re done with this one page. Then you just edit all the different pages. It&#039;s got a homepage and about page which talks about us. Then there&#039;s a contact page which says how to contact us.

Then we even have a blog. The basic blog function so you can write a couple of articles and put them online. Here&#039;s the first post, here&#039;s the second one, here&#039;s the third one. This is all just sample content which I&#039;ve got on here right now because obviously, you&#039;re going to replace this with your own. A lot of this isn&#039;t even real. These aren&#039;t real post. This is just a demo website hence the samovensdemo.com domain. Then you can click into these posts and there&#039;s a detailed blog post. There&#039;s also about the author. There&#039;s a comments function. You can see, this is a full on website. It has all the functions that a normal website has and it&#039;s everything you need to get started and you can get it with one click.

Then you can just edit your information in about 30 minutes and bam, you&#039;re live with your own website. It&#039;s also mobile responsive so it works on a mobile phone. Also, it has been designed to get results. On all the pages, you&#039;ll notice that it says, free case study, free case study and then even up here free case study. All these free case study call to action, it takes us to our fragmentation funnel which is the main funnel which I teach you to use in this program.

If someone clicks on the free case study, then they can register for the free case study. Enter in their email and it will take them to our value video and all of that stuff. If I enter in an email here, it takes me to the case study video which is our value video and it also says, apply now to see if you qualify. They can apply. It hooks up with our calendar scheduling system. They hold like pretty much everything. This is a full blow-in website. Everything you need to start your own consulting business. More than that, I&#039;ve also included privacy policy in terms. In here, you can click and you can see the privacy policy I&#039;ve already put in here for you.

All you need to do is change your company name. You just need to edit some information and this is good to go. Also, the terms you just need to change, edit some information and it&#039;s good to go. This is designed to be fully Facebook compliant so you can use this for Facebook ads. It&#039;s got the terms and the privacy policy. The reason why we have some blog posts is because that&#039;s also one of the requirements to conform with Facebook&#039;s rules. This is really everything you need to get started and you can install that with one click.

I&#039;m just going to go back to this page which I was on which is consulting.com/clickfunnels.

That is the consulting website. Then we have the fragmentation funnel which is that funnel which I showed you and I walked you through it. That&#039;s basically where you get your case study and you go through. You watch the value video. You can schedule a time and then you can â€¦ I&#039;ll walk you through it right now so you can see the full fragmentation funnel process live. Also, if you want to check it out yourself, you can just go to samovensdemo.com and click free case study.

Then you select the time and the date in the calendar. This will sync to your Google calendar. Then the prospect puts in their information and their phone number and everything. It schedules it. It&#039;s going to send emails to me and to the person that schedules the strategy session. It&#039;s running a bit slow right now. Then it takes us to step 2 of 2 which is a survey to reserve a strategy session. The reason why we use the survey is to collect some key information from our prospect and to determine whether they are a good fit or they just tie a kicker.

We want to filter people who are going to waste our time from people who are a good fit and this survey enables us to do that. This survey is fully editable. Obviously, I&#039;ve set mine up for my own business because I sell things to do with making money. That&#039;s why there&#039;s a lot of questions to do with financial stuff. However, if you&#039;re on a personal training niche or whatever, you will have a couple of questions that are different. If someone fills out this, they click a book, your strategy session. Then it says, Awesome! Your application is complete and your strategy session is scheduled and it gives some instructions.

The fragmentation funnel is a full end to end funnel. You can see its mobile responsive on every device. To view it, you can go samovensdemo.com/case-study. You can get a consulting website with one click. You can get the fragmentation funnel with one click. All you click is install template. I&#039;ve also included the lumpy mail pages and information about live webinar pages as well which we&#039;ll talk about soon in this video. If I go LM review, if I just click on this view live demo, it&#039;s not going to show me this right now. That&#039;s all right. I&#039;ll correct that link.

This is basically the landing page which shows the video review. If I go back to this really quickly and if click on the trashcan template in Google docs and if scroll down to the link, if I click on this link, if I go to this link here, this landing page here, I have created a template and everything so that you can install this with one click and be able to see all of these landing pages up when you use lumpy mail. To do that, you just install this template here, you click on install template and it will install the lumpy mail pages template into your system. Now, what that looks like when I go into this. If I go to my ClickFunnels account and I can look at lumpy mail pages here, when you click install template, it will load it into your account and it will show up like this.

Within lumpy mail pages, you can see these three steps. One is the review page. Two is the schedule page and three is the success page. The review page looks like this. If I click this button here, it will open it up and you says Plumb Quick. Here&#039;s some critical mistakes. There&#039;s the review video and then step two is to schedule a consultation. If they click that, they go to this. Basically, everything you need to take someone from the physical letter through to the landing page and then through to scheduled in your calendar. You&#039;ve got all of the pages, the review page, the schedule page and the success page.

What can you can do was on all of these pages you can click edit page and you can edit all of this information. It&#039;s very simple. You just click on it and you can change the name to whatever your name is, edit this. It&#039;s just very simple. Anyone can use this. It&#039;s very easy to use. I&#039;ve created the templates for you, the mobile responsive and everything. You just install them with one click. It could not get any easier. It took me an extreme amount of time to create all of this stuff for everyone and make it this simple.

If you want to know more about how to set up the landing pages and everything, I&#039;m not going to dive deep into it and at this video because in this video, we&#039;re covering all five of our organic attraction methods. If you want to dive deeper and get into the granular details for setting everything up, there&#039;s an instructional video here which shows you step by step. If I click on this link, it takes me to a video called lumpy mail instructions. Here, I go into detail about how to set everything up. I walk you through step by step exactly how to set up everything. If you need more info, more details through the cheat sheet, you can find everything you need. There&#039;s everything you could possibly need here.

That is it for the lumpy mail method. I&#039;ve shown you the work flow and the process here. I won&#039;t go into a lot of detail about this because there&#039;s more detail in that lumpy mail instructions video which I just showed you but very briefly, you just want to build a list of people then you want to use one of our templates or create one of your own. Then you want to create the physical lumpy mail packages first for all of the people you want to mail it to. Then you want to create your landing pages and online scheduling system using the system which I just showed you consulting.com/clickfunnels.

Then once you&#039;re ready to send them, you just send them via the post and that&#039;s it, very simple. To help you deploy it. Here are the different resources. 3D mail, you can go to consulting.com/3dmail or consulting.com/lumpymail. There&#039;s Shipito, there&#039;s the landing pages system and additional links on the cheat sheet. Here&#039;s when you should use lumpy mail. If you&#039;re in a niche where you can easily find people&#039;s physical address or location, lumpy mail is ideal. If you&#039;re in a niche where you can&#039;t find people&#039;s physical address or location, it&#039;s not ideal because how do we know where to send it to?

If you don&#039;t have huge money to spend on Facebook ads and by that, I mean if you&#039;re not spending $100 a day on ads then make sure that you&#039;re doing at least one to two lumpy mail mailings per day. You want to be sending direct outreach by email every day, going to be sending out one or two lumpy mail packages every day, you&#039;re going to be doing some posts and things on your Facebook profile every day. You want to get into the habit of doing these things every day and trying to build up that momentum and that critical mass so that get moving.

Many members in the program have used these lumpy mail templates and innovative versions of their own to generate paying clients. I&#039;ve seen people in the program used my exact templates and get results but I&#039;ve also seen people get awesome results from creating their own versions. If they&#039;re in a different niche, they choose that they create their own template, they find different objects to put inside them and they really find their own unique angles, and those worked really well. Lumpy mail works but it can be a bit mundane sending packages every day so mix it up with other methods too. If you can&#039;t possibly find physical addresses for people in your niche then this method won&#039;t really work.

Now let&#039;s talk about organic method number four which is called list farming. List farming is when we send broadcast emails to our list or database and invite them to a live webinar presentation where we present information useful to our niche and then at the end, we ask them to schedule a strategy session call with us if they would like additional help. If you have an existing email list or database, this is the lowest hanging fruit opportunity that you have right now and it&#039;s the fastest way to generate some sales quickly.

If you&#039;ve already been in business for a while, you&#039;ve already got an email list or already got followers and stuff, you want to use this method because it&#039;s the fastest way to generate a windfall of clients. Most people underestimate what they already have beneath their nose, and doing a simple list farming webinar can generate a windfall of new clients and profits very quickly with little to no effort. If you don&#039;t have a list or database, then don&#039;t worry, you can use this method later on when you do but this method is only for those people in this program who already have one and this is a way to kind of shake the tree and generate some business from what you already have.

Here&#039;s the process/workflow to deploy this method. Number one is to segment your list or database and prepare a segment of people ready for an email broadcast using whatever email or CRM tool you&#039;re using. Then step two is to create the slides for your webinar presentation. You want to create the slides so that you can do your webinar. You want to practice going through this one time yourself. Now, to do this, I&#039;ve provided everything you need. Because like all of these methods, I have personally used them and gotten results with them because everything in this program is battle tested and proven.

If I go to the list farming method cheat sheet, available in the resources section beneath this video if you download, it says, what is it? When should we use it? What are its pros and cons? What&#039;s the workflow? When you&#039;re creating your slideshow presentation, I&#039;ve given you everything you could possibly need here. First of all, I&#039;ve given you a sample webinar recording. You can view it here. I&#039;ve got a recording of a webinar which I did which work very well, called 7 steps to 7 figures with your coaching or consulting business. You can watch my webinar recording and see how I did it.

I&#039;ve also given you the transcript for that webinar. If you want to read it and kind of get an idea of what contents in there then you can view this transcript and this has word for word the entire webinar. It&#039;s like 48 pages or something. There&#039;s a lot of information in here. Then I&#039;ve also provided you with these slides. I&#039;ve given you my exact slides I used for this webinar. There is a keynote template available here or PowerPoint if you use Microsoft or if you use keynote on an Apple, so you can click here to download the keynote slides that will start the download to my computer, then I can grab the slides here.

In here, you can see every single slide from my entire webinar presentation. This isn&#039;t just some random webinar, this is a webinar which I used to produce more than â€¦ it must have been more $3.5 million worth of sales with this one webinar. I&#039;m giving you the good stuff. This one made me more than 3.5 million and it&#039;s still running today so it&#039;s a good one. It&#039;s a good one to learn from. When you&#039;re creating a webinar, you basically you want to start off with a catchy title and everything. Then you want to say who this is for, then what you&#039;re going to learn, then you want to say the house rules, then you want to go into, does this sound like you?

You&#039;re talking about different problems. You&#039;re trying to get the person to be like, &quot;Yes this is me, this is my problem, I need help with these things.&quot; Then you&#039;re saying, &quot;Well, there&#039;s a better way to do things and I&#039;m going to show what that better way is today.&quot; Then you&#039;re introducing yourself and your story and what you&#039;re an expert at and everything. Then if you&#039;ve got some client case studies, you can talk about them there. Then you want to go on and deliver the information. I&#039;m giving 7 steps to 7 figures, so there&#039;s seven pieces of information I give here.

I say number one, I make my point. Number one, I make my point then I back up my point with an explanation and then I provide a testimonial which further cements that point I&#039;m trying to make. Number two, my point, explanation, testimonial. Number three, my point, explanation, my testimonial and I do that and I go through the seven steps. That&#039;s how I provide the information to everyone. Then I provide some more testimonials and case studies. If you don&#039;t have any of those, that doesn&#039;t matter. Then I basically close with this point here. I&#039;m like, &quot;Well, at this point of the webinar, you basically have two options.&quot;

Number one is go at it alone. Number two is learn the proven system from someone who&#039;s done it. Then I basically say who it&#039;s for and then I have a call to action. I&#039;m basically getting people to apply for a strategy session with me if they want additional help. That&#039;s the call to action for my list farming webinar. Then what happens is people will go from the webinar, they will go online to schedule a strategy session with me. Now, in order to see it all of the stuff up, you need to set up some webinar landing pages because when you&#039;re sending out the emails to your list, people need to register for the webinar and everything.

Also, when you have your call to action in the webinar, people need a page to go to so that they can schedule into your calendar and complete the survey and all of that stuff. I&#039;ve provided you with the templates and everything. You can click this link here, consulting.com/clickfunnels. You want to click on install your funnels. Select if you have a ClickFunnels account or not. Then it will take you through and you&#039;ll be able to install the live webinar pages, that&#039;s the funnel you want. The live webinar pages funnel basically has these six tips.

Number one is the registration page which looks like this. It&#039;s a webinar landing page that says exclusive live webinar for coaches and consultants, the headline, some benefit, text, saying what they&#039;re going to learn, a photo of me, then they can click yes to reserve their seat. They can reserve their seat here. Then they go the success page and it says the date and the time and also the link to attend live on the day. That is the registration page and the registration success page. I provide you with the templates so that all you need to do is load these into your account with one click and then click on these different things and edit them so that they work for you, change your picture, change the privacy policy in terms so that it works for you. Voila! You&#039;re set up with that list farming webinar template and funnel.

Then you remember at a particular â€¦ when I&#039;m closing the webinar, I&#039;m putting in a call to action. I&#039;m saying, if you want to have a strategy session with me, you need to go to this URL and apply for one. Well, I need the landing pages for people to apply for strategy session. I have here the schedule page, survey page and success page and I can show what those look like here. It says schedule your breakthrough strategy session with Sam. They can schedule that. They can select the time and the date. Then it will take them through to the survey page which collects more of their information, enables us to filter. Then finally, it takes them to the success page which tells them what to expect on our upcoming call.

Now I provide you with everything you need here to deploy this method, all the templates and everything, mobile responsive, ready to go. All you have to do is edit each page to have your information in it instead of my information. Then you click publish, you set up your domain name, all of that stuff which I show you how to do it later on in week four and you&#039;re good to go. When it comes to setting up this technical stuff, there is a little bit more to it like connecting it to your webinar platform that you&#039;re using to host your webinars. What I&#039;ve done is I&#039;ve created an instructional video which shows you how to set everything up.

You can get that from this list farming method cheat sheet here. You just click on this link, it takes you through to a video which has â€¦ it&#039;s an hour long and it just walks you through step by step how to set up this list farming method. This is where we get really granular on all of the details so I show you how to edit everything, how to publish everything, how to link couple of the technology, how to test it. Everything you could possibly need to know when it comes to setting up a list farming webinar, this list farming instructions video has it all for you. That&#039;s what you can do if you want to have a deep dive and go further into the details here.

I&#039;ve also provided you with all of my invite emails. When you&#039;re doing a list farming webinar, you need to send emails to your list to invite them, to invite your people to register for your webinar. What I&#039;ve done is I&#039;ve given you actual email I&#039;ve send. Because with this training, I&#039;m not just giving you the theory, I&#039;m giving you the specifics. These aren&#039;t just cool ideas. These are things I&#039;ve actually used in the real world, on the frontlines to make money and I&#039;ve made millions of dollars with all of these methods. Like I said, this webinar has made me more than 3.5 million and I give you everything to know about it, the landing page, the whole â€¦ everything you need, and even the emails.

Here&#039;s the emails that I send to invite people to the webinar. I&#039;ve given you the subject lines, the copy, everything. What I typically do is I like to email Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and then email twice on Thursday and then do the webinar on Thursday. That gives me like five days, that gives me five emails to send to people leading up to the webinar to promote it. I&#039;ve given you day one email one, day two email two, day three email three, day four email four, and then day five email five. I&#039;ve given you all of the emails that you need.

Obviously, these are my exact emails so you don&#039;t copy paste them because it wouldn&#039;t work. You want to use these as inspiration and as examples of how to do this yourself and you can create your own versions. That&#039;s pretty much all of the resources. As you can see, there is a ton of resources here which I&#039;ve given you so that you have everything you could possibly need when it comes to setting up and deploying this list farming method. That pretty much covers us for the list farming method. Get back to our presentation. Like I said, to help you deploy this, I&#039;ve included all of these resources. They&#039;re all available in the cheat sheet.

Here&#039;s when you should use the list farming method. If you already have a list or database of people who follow you or are existing customers or clients, you should use it. If you want to generate some fast results with a little effort, little risk, it&#039;s a good method if you want to quickly test and iterate your new offer or message and see if it resonates with your people. If you&#039;ve already got a list and you&#039;re trying to kind of iterate and innovate your message and your offer a bit, it&#039;s quite good to test live sometimes because it enables you to make changes and iterations quicker because you&#039;re getting live feedback.

Then you can adjust everything that way and it&#039;s a really good way to get some quick testing done. If you want or you should run one of these immediately, if you already have a list, absolutely you should do it right now or once you&#039;re up and running, you want to aim to do a list farming webinar every 30 days. It&#039;s good practice. It&#039;s a good way to shake the tree on your list and get the right fruit out of it, the people who are ready to rock. Then you want to do a live webinar every 30 days. Make it a habit. Build it into your action plan. Just this alone will add huge amount of strategy sessions to your calendar every month.

A warning, if your list is too big like 3,000 plus people, then segment it for mailing because you don&#039;t want to overload your calendar with strategy sessions and burn good leads. I&#039;ve put that in there because I&#039;m just weary if someone&#039;s got like 50,000 contacts. They don&#039;t want to email them all to this webinar because they&#039;re not going to have enough time to give everyone strategy sessions so segment that list. Now, organic method number five which is the JV webinar. The JV webinar, this is a joint venture webinar with somebody in your marketplace who serves your ideal client in a noncompetitive way, and an example to really cement your understanding of this.

If you&#039;re selling accountant training services and you partner with an accounting software company and you serve the same people and can help each other while not competing with core business offers. If I&#039;m selling training to help accountant sell more, well my market, my niche is they&#039;re accountants. Who else is targeting accountants? Well, accounting software companies like FreshBook, Xero, stuff like that. Now, are we competitive? No because I&#039;m selling consulting and training and the software companies are selling their software so were not competing with each other yet we&#039;re still serving the same people.

When that sort of relationship exists, it is prime for a joint venture opportunity and a joint venture webinar. You basically want to make sure that you&#039;re serving the same people but you&#039;re not competing on core business offers. This strategy doesn&#039;t work until you have built up a bit of a track record and some proven results because most JVs won&#039;t trust you until you can show proof. When a JV is emailing their people for you, basically how a JV webinar works is instead of you emailing your people and saying, &quot;Hey, come on this webinar,&quot; somebody else is emailing their people and they&#039;re saying, &quot;Hey you should get on this guy Sam&#039;s webinar.&quot;

We&#039;re leveraging somebody else&#039;s lists, somebody else&#039;s context, and somebody else&#039;s reputation into the industry. It&#039;s a very powerful way to grow by doing it because you get delivered somebody else&#039;s list of network and everything. However, people aren&#039;t going to give you that opportunity if they are scared that it might ruin their reputation because a reputation is everything when it comes to your customers and everything. The last thing someone wants to do is do a JV with someone who they don&#039;t know and who doesn&#039;t have a track record because if it blows up, then they&#039;re going to look bad in front of their customers and that&#039;s going to cause them a lot of money.

That&#039;s why you need to have this before you build up to this. If you don&#039;t have this right now, that&#039;s totally fine. You don&#039;t need to worry about this method. However, if you are ready to do this, then awesome, you should definitely try it out. It&#039;s a very powerful method. A lot of people think that JV&#039;s is just about making money and when they pitch the JV partner, they say, hey look I can make you all these money. True, money is important. People definitely care about it but people care about their reputation before money. Because no one wants to do a JV promotion for someone they don&#039;t know and risk their reputation which has taken them a long time to build up just for some quick money. No one does that.

It&#039;s really important to remember that the reputation and delivering value is of more importance than money. When you start conversations with potential JV partners, keep that in mind. You want to show how you&#039;re going to be able to serve your JV partner&#039;s clients and help them with their life and their business and deliver value in everything before you get into the financials about it. It will improve your approach in your pitch when you go to do that. If you have an established reputation and track record, the JV webinar method is seriously powerful and I highly recommend it.

Here&#039;s the process and the workflow to deploy this attraction method. Once you&#039;ve got your reputation, you can start by looking at potential JV partners who serve your clients in a noncompetitive way. Like I talked about, if we&#039;re selling accounting training services, we could find accounting software companies. Then we can create a list of 5 to 10 potential JV partners. We just want to, first of all, canvass the landscape of the environment that we operate our business in and see who the players are and see who we could potentially JV with. Create that list. Put it in Google Docs or in Excel file.

Then you want to find the name and email address and the Facebook profile and whatnot for the different people who you&#039;ve identified. Then when you&#039;ve got to the contact information, you wanted to contact them just by sending them an email or a Facebook message. You want to float the idea of a promotion. Don&#039;t start the conversations with money like I said because that&#039;s not what&#039;s important to people. Their reputation and delivering value is of more importance. Then you want to agree on a pricing model or revenue split that works for the both of you and then agree to move forward with it and make it happen.

Once their reputation and all that stuff is figured out and you&#039;ve established some rapport with the JV partner, you can agree on a date and everything and then you&#039;ll probably going to discuss the pricing and so you&#039;re going to split the revenue somehow. This can go one of two ways. One way is you can pay per strategy session. You could pay $200 per strategy session. That&#039;s one way you could do it or you could pay $1000 per customer. That&#039;s what I pay. You&#039;ve got to figure out what numbers would work for you and your business. You&#039;ve got to come up with those but this is what I typically pay. It&#039;s because I know my numbers and I can happily pay $1000 to acquire customer and happily pay $200 to acquire strategy session and still make a lot of profit.

In that way, the JV partner is getting a reward for promoting us and we splitting the revenues and that&#039;s how a joint venture happens. Then once you&#039;ve nailed down all the pricing and all of that, you want to schedule the time to do the live webinar and it&#039;s basically the same webinar as the list farming webinar which I showed you in organic method number four just before this one, it&#039;s essentially the same webinar and the same process. However, there are some key differences. They key differences are, number one, that instead of you emailing your lists to bring people on to attend the webinar, the JV partner is emailing their list so they&#039;re getting people to register for your webinar but they&#039;re coming from the JV partner&#039;s list and they&#039;re coming from his emails which he sends to his list.

The other difference is that at the beginning of the webinar, the JV partner is going to introduce you because most of the people who attend this webinar are going to be followers and fans of the JV partner and not you. Then it&#039;s important that the JV partner is there at the beginning to say, &quot;Welcome everyone, welcome to this webinar. I wanted to get Sam on and to do a webinar for you because I&#039;ve been watching what he&#039;s doing and it&#039;s awesome stuff. I think he can really help a lot of people, really add a lot of value.&quot; When the JV partner does that introduction, it transfers some of that authority and reputation that the JV partner has built up onto us.

Now, were positioned in a good way to deliver the presentation and get people to trust us because someone else has endorsed us, it&#039;s an endorsement. Those are the key differences to doing it. Now, once the JV partner has introduced you, you go ahead and deliver your webinar the same way you always would. Then at the end, you have a call to action where you&#039;re getting people to apply for a strategy session. It&#039;s pretty much the same set up as the live webinar method or the list farming method but couple of differences.

Now, when it comes to setting one of these up for yourself, you can download the JV webinar method cheat sheet in the resources section below this video. Here, you can see what is it? When should we use it? What are its pros and cons? What&#039;s the process/workflow? How to set it all up? Then I&#039;ve given you a ton of information and resources again, everything you could need. The webinar recording, you can watch the whole video. It&#039;s the same webinar which we used for the list farming one. Then I&#039;ve given you the webinar transcript. Then I&#039;ve given you the slides available in keynote and PowerPoint. Then I&#039;ve given you the landing page templates which you can download.

You can go to consulting.com/clickfunnels and you can install your funnels with one click. You can install those webinar ones. The funnel is essentially the same as the live webinar funnel. All we are doing is we&#039;re setting it up for a JV webinar. On this registration page, the key difference would be that we would have a photo of me and the JV partner here. That would be the key difference. Other than that, everything is pretty much the same. That is landing page templates which you can get. Then I&#039;ve given you invite emails. Like I said, with everything in this program, it&#039;s battle tested and proven. It&#039;s not just theory or some cool ideas which I came up with.

I&#039;ve used this stuff to make millions of dollars. When it comes to the JV webinar method, I&#039;ve given you actual invite emails that I have used with Tai Lopez when we did a JV webinar together. This webinar which we have done so far has made more than $5 million. When I showed you my list farming method, that one made more than 3 million. When I showed you all of the other methods, they&#039;ve all made more than a million dollars each on their own. This one here has made me over 5 million. I&#039;ve given you the exact emails. These are emails coming from Tai to his people on his list. However, I wrote them all for him.

Often, that&#039;s what you do with JV partners because you know your message better than the JV partner so you draft up the emails for them and then they will edit them a little bit and send them to their list for you. These are basically emails driving people to the landing page where they&#039;re going to register for the webinar. You can read through all of them. I&#039;ve included five of these for you. You can see email one, two, three, four, five. Real life emails that we send to make a lot of money with a real life JV webinar. I&#039;ve given you the templates and the funnels and all of that stuff which you need to set everything up, all the resources you could possibly need.

I&#039;ve also created an instructional video showing you how to set everything up. Like I said, this video here which you&#039;re watching right now, it is kind of a high level view of the five different organic methods which we used to get clients. Now once you know what methods you want to deploy specifically, you can deep dive and pull up more granular information and find out how to set everything up step by step. To do that, we&#039;re in the JV webinar method cheat sheet and I just clicked on instructional video here. Oops, that&#039;s the wrong link there. I will fix that up.

There is a video which says JV webinar instructions and it&#039;s basically a video which will come up and it&#039;s about an hour long and it shows you step by step how to set up the JV webinar process. It goes into granular detail about how to set up ClickFunnels, how to set up all of the stuff. Don&#039;t worry if I&#039;ve skimmed over anything in here. We&#039;ve got full one hour video which walks you through everything in detail. That is the organic method number five, the JV webinar. Like I said, we&#039;ve provided you with all of these resources. The best place to find those is in the cheat sheet.

Here&#039;s when you should use the JV webinar method. If you&#039;ve been in business for a while and have an established reputation and track record of clients, then the JV webinar method is going to work well for you. Also, if you&#039;re well connected with other people who served your niche and you&#039;re able to arrange JV webinars, awesome. JV webinar is going to work for you right now. A pro tip, become your ideal JV partners customer first. The best way to build up relationships with people is to become their customer first and start by building a friendship and a customer-client relationship first.

Then once it&#039;s warmed up, ask for the opportunity to do a JV. You want to build friendship and trust first and then ask for the opportunity to do a business because like I said, JV is not so much done on money but more on trust and reputation and knowing that it&#039;s a safe move to recommend you to their list and their following. When you&#039;re established and have a proven track record, you should aim to do one JV webinar every second month of the year and that&#039;s a total of six JV webinars per year. It&#039;s a great way to generate interest and business.

Like I said, I do JV webinars. I do all of the methods which I have described to you in this video today, all five of them. What I want to do right now is really just bring it all together and explain the next steps from here because we&#039;ve covered a lot of ground and a lot of different information in this video. We&#039;ve looked an in-depth review of all of these. The number one, Facebook posts. Number two, direct outreach. Number three, lumpy mail. Number four, list farming, and number five, the JV webinar.

Now, I&#039;ve given you the theory behind all of these. I&#039;ve also given you the templates, swipe files, examples, real life examples I&#039;ve used and even the technology and instructions, everything you could possibly need for every single one of these methods. You know these methods work because I&#039;ve personally used them in my business as I&#039;ve shown you with all of the examples. I&#039;ve given you real life examples for each one. Each one of these methods has made me more than a million dollars, some of them multiple millions. These are powerful methods that really work.

You&#039;ve got all of the information you need here. Now, like I said, this video is like a high level view of everything to give you a full picture of a full 360 degree view of everything that we have at our disposal when it comes to organic methods. What you want to do is pick which ones you&#039;re going to use and then deep dive into them with the cheat sheets and get the resources you need so that you can set everything up.

Now let&#039;s discuss some action items from this training module. You want to start thinking about our five organic attraction methods and decide which ones you&#039;re going to deploy this week. Now I showed you all five, as you can see, there&#039;s a lot of work if you do all five. I don&#039;t recommend that you do all five. At no time am I even doing all five. Most of the time, I&#039;m generally doing a mixture of about two. What I recommend doing is picking from the choices of organic attraction methods that we have and selecting which ones you&#039;re going to deploy immediately.

Don&#039;t think about it next month, next year. Don&#039;t think about anything like that. I want you to choose what are you going to deploy this week, make your decision and then become familiar with those specific attraction methods. Then everyone, absolutely everyone in this program should clean up their Facebook profile and do your first Facebook post today. The best time to do it is today. You want to go to your Facebook profile, your personal one. Clean it up. Put your iHow blank to blank by blank statement there and then write your first post. Get it done.

I recommend posting to your entire friend&#039;s list. If you&#039;re not comfortably doing that, you can create a business list and segment people into it before posting and I showed you how to do that earlier in the video today. Then everyone should create a list of 10 to 100 ideal clients in your niche and then start using direct outreach to get in contact with them. You open up Google, start creating a list of people who you believe are an ideal client for yours. Just start searching for them. Put them down into a Google doc. Put them into a spreadsheet.

Then once you&#039;ve got 10 to 100 of these. Then you want to start using direct outreach to get in touch with them, direct outreach that&#039;s just an email or a Facebook message or a linked in message so get your first two or three direct outreach messages out today. If you want to know how the winners do it in this program, if you want to know how people make six figures, seven figures and really changed their life, they learned the training and then they go and take action immediately. That&#039;s the best thing you can do. What you want to do, clean up that profile, do your first post. Then go and build that list of ideal clients and send out your first direct outreach messages right now. Get it done.

Then aim to send 5 to 10 direct outreach messages to new people in your niche every single day. Make it a habit. Make it something that you do first thing when you wake up is send out some messages. You want to start building up momentum like this because it might seem like you&#039;re not doing much at the beginning and you might not get much interest on your first couple of days but believe me, after you&#039;ve built this up over a period of say 20, 30 days, things are going to be happening, things are going to be moving for you. You&#039;re going to be getting results.

Then if you have an email list or a database right now, then you should consider kicking things off with a bang using the list farming method which we discussed. If you don&#039;t have a list or a database, don&#039;t worry about it. If you have warmed up JV partners already, you should consider using a live JV webinar to schedule your first batch of strategy sessions. If you don&#039;t have JV partners or if you don&#039;t have an amazing track record yet, then just don&#039;t worry about this last method right now. You can come back to this later on.

I wanted to design and create this training program so that it serves as a resource like forever in an ongoing way. You can come through it the first time and you can take from the program the different pieces which you need to execute to get where you want to go. As you evolved and as you grow bigger, then you can come back and you can be like, &quot;Oh okay. Now I can do the list farming method and now I can do the JV webinar method because I&#039;m a bit more established now.&quot; That&#039;s why I wanted to provide you with a range of different things here, and so those are the action items for this week.

I can&#039;t stress it enough. You want to clean your Facebook profile up right now, do your first Facebook post right now and create that list of ideal clients and start sending out those direct outreach emails right now. Get it done. That&#039;s how you get momentum. That&#039;s how you get results and build up confidence in this program.

That&#039;s it for this training video. Thank you everyone for watching and I&#039;ll see you on the next one.
