Let&#039;s jump right into it.

Here&#039;s what we&#039;re going to cover today. First of all, what does assembling the war machine mean, and why is it important? I&#039;m going to explain why I chose this title and also what our goals and objectives are when it comes to assembling the war machine. Then, we&#039;re going to go through the different parts of assembling the war machine. There&#039;s six different parts. The first one is choosing a name and domain name for your consulting business. This is a big one that I see lots of people get tripped on. I see people posting on their Facebook group, they&#039;re like, &quot;What should I call my consulting business? Help I&#039;m in pain, I&#039;ve spent two days trying to come up with a name.&quot; It&#039;s pretty ridiculous really, I mean it&#039;s just a name. I&#039;m going to show you a way to choose a name, and a domain name for your consulting business and register it, buy it, the whole thing in under 10 minutes.

Then I&#039;m going to show you how to set up your business website. This is another one that I see people really getting completely stuck on and really putting themselves through a lot of pain and a lot of turmoil. They&#039;re like, &quot;How should I build my website? Should I use WordPress, should I use Squarespace? What theme should I use? How do my photos look?&quot; People just waste so much time on their website, it&#039;s mind boggling. I&#039;m going to show you how to set up your website in about three hours without touching WordPress or any of that stuff. I&#039;ve got a template that you can use in this training video today. You can just install it with one click. It&#039;s a awesome website. It&#039;s all you need and more, works on mobile and everything, looks great.

We&#039;re going to show you how to get that done. I&#039;m also going to show you how to set up your business email and calendar. I notice quite a lot of people, they send direct outreach emails from their personal email account. They start their business, and they actually start running their business using their personal email account. I&#039;ve seen a lot of people use like, <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="bcd6d3d4d2ded1c48d8bfcdbd1ddd5d054dfd3d1">[email&#160;protected]</a>, like some account they set up when they were like 16 or something, because they like BMX. That&#039;s one of the better ones. Sometimes I see some email accounts that are like, <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="ccbca5a2a7a0a3a0a0a5bca3bcbff58ca4a3b8a1ada5a0e2afa3a1">[email&#160;protected]</a>, and there&#039;s really nothing wrong with it, but it&#039;s just not the best look.

It&#039;s also messy for you, because as you&#039;re trying to run your business, and you&#039;re looking through your business email, it&#039;s also mixed with all of this personal stuff, and it&#039;s just not the way to run a business. It&#039;s certainly not the best look when it comes to generating clients. I&#039;m going to show you how to set up a business email account using your domain name. So, if your domain name is samovensconsulting.com, I can show you how to set up an email that&#039;s <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="a2d1c3cfe2d1c3cfcdd4c7ccd1c1cdccd1d7ced6cbccc58cc1cdcf8c">[email&#160;protected]</a> That&#039;s what you should be using for all of your business communications with your prospective clients, end clients, and vendors and everything.

It&#039;s also what you should be using for sending out your direct outreach and everything related to your business so that you&#039;ve got it all stored in one location. If you go back looking for receipts, or back looking for business communications, you&#039;ve got them all there and also it&#039;s a good look when sending direct outreach and everything, because people can see you&#039;re sending it from a business email, not a personal email, which will improve your chances of getting a client.

I&#039;m going to show you how to set it up using an awesome tool, which allows you to have your business email and your calendar and your online storage all accessible with one login from any computer or any mobile phone. It&#039;s super cheap, it&#039;s really reliable, and honestly, I would recommend it to anybody. I&#039;m going to show you step-by-step how to set all of that up. It&#039;s really quick, really easy, that&#039;s what we&#039;re going to cover in this video today.

Then I&#039;m going to show you how to set up your fragmentation funnel. Your fragmentation funnel is the step-by-step process that we use to take someone from Facebook ads, to a scheduled appointment to now calendar. It&#039;s a collection of web pages that are linked together systematically to really qualify someone and step them forward and through the process. It&#039;s really our way of identifying the 3% who are ready to buy now. It&#039;s like our natural selection engine, if you want to call it that.

Then I&#039;m going to tell you how to register your business, officially with the government. This is a big one, because I see a lot of people posting about this on their Facebook group, I know it also trips a lot of people up, they&#039;re like, &quot;What sort of business should I start? Should I do an LLC? Should I do a C Corp? Should I do a ...&quot; all sorts of different things. It stumps people, and a lot of people are like, &quot;Do I need to talk to a lawyer? Do I need to do this?&quot; They get overwhelmed. I&#039;m going to show you really quickly and really easily and for pretty much no money, how to register your business. Doesn&#039;t matter what country in the world you are, I&#039;m going to show you how to do it.

Then I&#039;m going to show you how to accept credit cards and set up your business banking. Once you&#039;ve registered your business, which we&#039;re going to show you how to do that, I&#039;m going to show you how to set up some business bank accounts. You just want two basic accounts, a checking and a savings, and you want to get a debit card for your business expenses, so you can separate your business expenses from your personal expenses. Then you want to link that business checking account up to a merchant processor, so that you can accept credit cards.

When it comes to business, accepting credit cards, it&#039;s like one of the most important things. If you&#039;re asking me like, &quot;What are some of the most important systems and operations inside my entire company?&quot; Well, accepting credit cards would be right up there. If it wasn&#039;t for that, then we wouldn&#039;t have any money, without any money, we&#039;d run out of oxygen very quick. Accepting credit cards is mandatory in the modern marketplace, because if you&#039;re asking for checks, if you&#039;re asking for bank wires and that sort of stuff, it&#039;s too much friction these days. People want to pay for things, they want to pay for things easily and quickly. They want to pay for things over the phone, or online, they don&#039;t want to have to screw around with checks and all of that stuff. If you have the ability to accept credit cards, it will dramatically increase your chances of closing clients, getting paid, making money, and really running an efficient business, because then you don&#039;t have to deal with bank wires and checks and all of that stuff, which is a nightmare to deal with.

When you&#039;re doing the sales call, you can just get them to sign up, you ask for their card information, you enter it in on your computer and then boom, it charges their account, and then it will process into your account in two to three days time, as simple as that. I&#039;m going to show you how to set all of this stuff up in this training video today.

This video is going to kind of be like a high level 30,000 foot view across all of these different things, why they&#039;re important, why we need to do them. Then what we&#039;re going to do is, we&#039;re going to drill down into each one and get into the granular step-by-step instructions. It&#039;s a very comprehensive training this one. I show you really, from a high level, all the way down to step-by-step what to click on, what service to use, everything. We haven&#039;t missed a single little piece in this. There&#039;s no way really anyone can get stuck and there&#039;s no excuse why anyone can&#039;t set all of this stuff up in a really short amount of time. It took me a very long time to put this video together for you guys. I know you&#039;re going to enjoy it. I know it&#039;s going to contribute to your results and everything, so let&#039;s get started and go through each of these.

Assembling the war machine. What is it? Why does it have this name? Well, we should be at right now in this program, here&#039;s where you should be if you&#039;ve been following through the program, watching the training and doing the action items and basically doing what you were supposed to be doing. You should have your niche offer result hypothesis ready. That&#039;s back from week one. You should also have your goals and visions set. You should know what you want. You should know what your dream is. You should really have this stuff written down in your mindset pack and all of that. We did that in week two.

Then you should have your sales script modified and practiced. We did that in week three. You should have really learned the script, you should have adjusted it to be suitable for yourself, your niche, your offer and everything. You should have practiced it with some other members in the program. Don&#039;t be one of those people that doesn&#039;t practice it with other members, because I can tell you it really does contribute to results. Then you should have an understanding of both organic and paid client attraction methods. That&#039;s what we did this week, in week four. We went over natural selection, which was kind of like the principles and the strategy, and then we dove into some of the tactics, which were categorized into organic, which is free, or near free, and then paid, which is obviously paid.

Then we went down into granular detail about how to set those different things up, the math that makes them all work and everything. You should have a thorough understanding right now of all of this stuff, and you should also be quite far along in terms of actually setting up your consulting business and getting it ready to go to market and getting it ready for battle. At this point, I usually tell people that they&#039;re ready for battle and tell them to go for it. That&#039;s what I&#039;ve done in my previous training programs. But, I kept noticing that some people stalled, it wasn&#039;t just some people, it was quite a lot of people stalled. The same questions kept coming up.

Here&#039;s some of the common reasons why people stalled about at this point right now. One of them I noticed was that people don&#039;t believe their market will take them seriously because they&#039;re not established. I see this in the Facebook group and on the Q&amp;A calls all the time, people are like, &quot;I&#039;ve got everything ready. I&#039;ve got the stuff on paper. I think I found something here. I think I found a real need and a real gap in this marketplace where I can really serve people and add some value, but I don&#039;t know if anyone&#039;s going to take me seriously. I don&#039;t have anything, like, I don&#039;t have a website, I don&#039;t have a company name, I don&#039;t have anything.&quot;

The truth is, is you don&#039;t really need it, but I get where people are coming from. I could tell people forever, like, you don&#039;t need it, but they&#039;re still going to feel uncomfortable without it. It&#039;s kind of an issue there. I tell people, &quot;Well, you don&#039;t need it.&quot; But then they feel like they do, and then they&#039;re uncomfortable, so they don&#039;t take any action. This time around, I&#039;ve decided to something about it. People also get paralyzed because they don&#039;t have a fancy website, case studies, testimonials and 50,000 Facebook fans, etc, etc, you know, the list goes on. We could write a list for 10 slides of all the different fancy things that you could have.

A lot of people don&#039;t take action, because they don&#039;t understand and possess the basic technology to take action and schedule appointments. Some people, they&#039;re not able to set up their funnel, or they don&#039;t know how to set up a schedule once, so they can get people to schedule their appointments. They also don&#039;t have a good scheduling system. They&#039;ve never really used an online calendar before in their life, or the only online calendar they&#039;ve used is like, Outlook, at their corporate job, which is totally different to how things work outside of corporate. A lot of people don&#039;t have the tech to really make things run, or make things run efficiently.

I&#039;ve noticed that they don&#039;t have a registered company name, or a registered business, and they don&#039;t have a bank account, or the ability to accept payments via the phone. This was a big one, because legally, and technically, you don&#039;t need to register a business. You can go out as yourself, and you can sign up clients, and you can give them an invoice, and you can collect payment and everything, and it&#039;s totally legal. You can file your tax returns at the end of the year as a person, you just put down that work is contract work, and you know, it&#039;s all legal, and you can do it, there&#039;s nothing wrong with doing it. However, it&#039;s not the best look when you&#039;re trying to start a consulting business.

Typically, the people that do that, just the people who have kind have got a random job here and there and there&#039;s no point in registering a business. It&#039;s not the best look. Really, with how simple, cheap and easy it is to register a business and how many benefits you get from doing it, there&#039;s no reason why you shouldn&#039;t. I&#039;ve also noticed that people don&#039;t have a specific plan detailing their exact daily action items for the immediate steps in front of them. This was a big one.

I noticed that we taught everyone the strategy, we taught everyone the tactics and everything, we covered a lot of ground and we really transformed these people big time, but what they were missing was just the immediate steps in front of them. Like, I&#039;ve got all of this information, I understand all of the stuff, I&#039;ve got this opportunity looking right at me in the face, but just how do I just take these immediate steps forward right now. What does the next seven days look like? What about the next 14 days? The next 30 days, what does that look like? That&#039;s really another thing that I noticed that was stalling people.

These together were really responsible for stalling a huge amount of people in this training program. Typically, I&#039;ve just said to people, &quot;You know, go ahead and just, you know, start getting clients.&quot; Tons of people went ahead and started getting clients. Don&#039;t get me wrong, it still worked amazingly well, we still have a record number of successful students and everything, but I did notice that these were some of the issues that other people who were paralyzed and couldn&#039;t take action were coming up against. In this version of the training program, I am going to address all of these things, and obliterate them so that there is really no excuses why anyone can&#039;t go out there and start taking action and start getting clients right away.

While everybody had the big picture things ready, it was the smaller, immediate action steps and tools that people needed to be confident enough to make a move. Noticing this common issue, I decided to put together this video showing you exactly how to tool up you and your business for battle. That&#039;s why I called this video Assembling The War Machine, because it really is how to prepare yourself for success on the business battle field. We&#039;re going to show you how to really tool up, you know, how to really take everything you&#039;ve got right now and arm it with these six things so that you can go out onto the battle field and succeed.

In order to prepare yourself for battle in business, you need four main things. Number one is you need a business name, a domain name, a website and a business email and calendar. Now I know for some people these things might seem just too simple to really make any sense, but, I&#039;ve noticed after having more than 10,000 people come through my programs, that these things ... a lot of people don&#039;t know how to do them and a lot of people still have to talk to other people like lawyers, or talk to technology people about how to set this stuff up. They see it as a huge burden and as a huge obstacle.

I wanted to address that in this training and really make it simple and show you the optimal way to set it all up. That&#039;s number one. You need that to go to battle in business. You also need number two, a fragmentation funnel. A fragmentation funnel is what we use to take interested prospects from strangers to scheduled appointments. It&#039;s basically a series of webpages linked together that shows someone a value video, we get their email address, we get them to schedule an appointment, fill out a survey, all of that stuff. Then number three, a registered business, a bank account and the ability to accept credit cards via the phone. Like I said earlier, having a registered business is important. A lot of clients say, &quot;Hey what&#039;s your business name?&quot; Or they ask for an invoice with a business name on it, or they might ask for a receipt and they expect like a business name on it. This isn&#039;t mandatory, it&#039;s still legal to operate and trade without one, however, it&#039;s just not a good look.

I wanted in this training to really leave no stone untuned and to really make sure that everyone in this program is coming out like an absolute ninja so that they can really master their different markets and really be successful. I wanted to show you how to do everything properly. In this training I&#039;m going to show you how to register your own business properly and then get your own business bank accounts so that you can separate business expense from personal expense and believe me, you want to do that from the very beginning. You don&#039;t want to wait six months to a year to do that, because it will be a big mess by the time you decide to.

You also want to have a business debit card so that you can put all of your business expenses on that, and then when you&#039;re out and about buying coffees and sandwiches and in things, you can put that on your personal account. That way you keep things nice and separate and it allows you to manage and monitor everything a lot more effectively. The ability to accept credit cards via the phone and online, that is essential, that is so big, that one thing alone can really make or break someone. I can&#039;t even describe how important it is to have the ability to accept credit cards. In order to do that, you have to have a registered business, a bank account, all that stuff. That is huge tool to have in your arsenal when it comes to business.

Number four is an immediate action plan for the next 30 days that shows you exactly what to do each day. It&#039;s all very well having a well trained army that&#039;s armed to the teeth with ammunition and weaponry and all of that stuff, but if it doesn&#039;t have an action plan, if the troops don&#039;t have an action plan to execute and follow on, well, nothing&#039;s really going to happen. It doesn&#039;t matter how well armed they are, it doesn&#039;t matter how well trained they are, without an immediate action plan, it kind of all goes to waste.

These are the four things that you need to prepare for battle in business. When you have all four of these things, you really become unstoppable and you become a force to be reckoned with. That&#039;s what everyone is going to become at the end to this training program.

Once you have these four things, you will appear more established than most other people in your market and have everything you need to be taken seriously by your prospects and your marketplace. You will also have an exact action plan detailing everything you need to do for the next 30 days, day by day, everything. All you need to do is wake up each morning and go. You will be prepared, you will have the technology and you will know exactly what to do. The only thing left to do, will be to take action and execute what is on the plan.

Once you&#039;ve really assembled the war machine and completed these six things, each morning, all you have to do is wake up, look at your action plan and execute on it. Do the things on the list, that&#039;s it. That&#039;s how simple it is. If you do the things on that list, then you will be successful, and it&#039;s as simple as that. Let&#039;s get to work and get it done. Number one, choosing a name and domain name for your consulting business. People over complicate this one all the time, I can&#039;t tell you how many different things I&#039;ve seen. Some of them are actually quite funny. They put themselves through agony.

I&#039;ve created a simple method for naming your consulting business in less than 10 minutes. That&#039;s how long it should take. Any single minute longer than 10 minutes, means you&#039;re totally wasting your time and you&#039;re being an idiot about it. Here&#039;s how to name your business in less than 10 minutes. When naming your consulting business, choose from one of the following three options. I&#039;ve given you some formulas here, number one, as you can use, first name, last name.com, eg, samovens.com. That took me less than 10 minutes to come up with, it probably took me one. You can see how simple it is there.

I grew my business to how much money on that one? Like, quite a lot, I think I grew it to like, it was like 18 million dollars just on that domain name. I haven&#039;t even properly migrated to consulting.com yet. I grew my business that far on just my first name, last name.com. That&#039;s a good option to go for. If that&#039;s available for you and you want to operate as first name, last name.com then do it. Another option is last name consulting.com. For example, ovensconsulting.com, pretty simple. If your last name was, Briggs, and you would just go with briggsconsulting.com, so simple, right?

Or, option number three, anything else you can come up with, provided you can choose it in less than 10 minutes. You can choose some fancy name, there&#039;s nothing wrong with that, but you&#039;ve got to be able to do it in less than 10 minutes. If you can&#039;t do it in less than 10 minutes, then choose one of these other ones. I see people trying to come up with all this fancy stuff, it&#039;s like they&#039;re trying to name like a new Burberry bag with aligator skin. I see people almost in tears trying to choose a name for their business, and it&#039;s ridiculous. You can always change it later.

I had samovens.com, I was running as that for a long time, until I had enough money to buy consulting.com, right? You can change the name of your business and it&#039;s really easy to do it, and these things, they don&#039;t really matter. All you want to do is make sure you do it in less than 10 minutes, any more than that and you&#039;re wasting time. Once you&#039;ve got that done, the next step is to register your domain name. Your domain name is basically how people go to your website. For example, one of my domain names is samovens.com. That&#039;s a domain name. Another one of my domains is consulting.com.

We can register your domain name in less than five minutes for $12 or less, and we can do it right now. To do that, for each of these six different things, which I&#039;m going to show you in this training video today, I&#039;ve included cheat sheets, or like a basic PDF, which walks you through the instructions, step-by-step, because a lot of these things, which I&#039;m going to show you in this video today, they&#039;re quite process oriented. They require you to go through a step-by-step work flow and sometimes providing that in a video format isn&#039;t the best, because you&#039;ve got to pause the video, go back and do all of this, and sometimes it&#039;s best to just have an instruction sheet for it.

Like I said, I&#039;ve created this video to kind of be the 30,000 foot overview, which explains why you need to everything and all of that, and then, when you want to drill down into these individual tasks, then you can go into the resources section. This first one, Choosing a Name and Domain, it&#039;s available for download, beneath this video; PDF. I&#039;ll open it up right here, and you can see it here, it says, choosing a name and domain cheat sheet.

At the top it just says a basic introduction so that you know what&#039;s it about, and then there&#039;s instructions. Here I say, here&#039;s the three different options you can use, and then once you have a name for your consulting business, the next step is to purchase your domain name. To do this you go to namecheap.com, given you the link there, you can just click on that. Type your desired domain name into the search box, on the namecheap website, for example, samovens.com, or ovensconsulting.com, and search to see if your desired domain name is available.

I can look at this right now, this is the namecheap website, I could type in here samovensconulting.com, it&#039;s probably available, it&#039;s not available, don&#039;t know who that is, but you can see how you go through here, and you can see if your name is available. Now, a lot of people will just be able to get their first name, last name.com. If you can&#039;t, you should be able to get your last name consulting.com. You&#039;ve just got to try out a few different things. Then, when you&#039;re ready to buy your domain, you just click Add to Cart. Your domain name shouldn&#039;t really cost you anymore than 12 bucks. You just click Add to Cart, and you go through the checkout options.

I recommend you use namecheap.com for that. I&#039;ve used it since I got started like five years ago. It&#039;s an awesome tool, and I know it&#039;s one of the better ones to use. If your desired domain name is available, go ahead and purchase it right away by following the instructions on the website. You don&#039;t need any of the add-ons, and you only need to register it for one year, since you can renew it later. They&#039;re going to try to sell you a whole bunch of stuff, but it&#039;s fine, you don&#039;t need it, it&#039;ll only cost you about 12 bucks.

If your desired domain name isn&#039;t available, then you will have to try an alternative domain name, or an alternative domain name suffix, like, .co, .net, .me, so on and so forth. Registering your business using a .com domain name is recommended, however, it&#039;s not mandatory. There&#039;s still multi-million dollar companies ... There&#039;s still companies way bigger than mine that use .net, .co, etc. it&#039;s not the end of the world, however, it is preferable to get the .com. Do your best to get a .com, however, if there&#039;s nothing available, go with a .net, that would be second preference, then .co, or .me.

Once you have purchase your domain name, make sure you write down your Namecheap login credentials, so that you can log back in later on when we need to point it towards your website in marketing funnels. We just need to remember that login there, so make sure you save it. Then that&#039;s it, that&#039;s all we need to do for now. Congratulations you have chosen a name for your consulting business, and you&#039;ve also purchased your domain name. You&#039;re ready to rock. Number one is done. That is the first thing to do when assembling a war machine.

Number two is setting up your business website. This is another one that just absolutely grapples with people. It really gets people, it really hooks them in it. It really aggravates people and just really gets under their skin. To be honest, I don&#039;t blame you, I put myself through some agony too with this one. People are always wondering, like, &quot;Should I use WordPress or Squarespace,&quot; or I don&#039;t know what these other ones are called, but I know there&#039;s at least 1000 of them. Then people are talking of, &quot;What theme should I use? Should I use this? Should I use that? Should it squiggle this way? Should it have a slider on it? Should it do all of these different things? What design? How should it look? What colors?&quot; All of this stuff, &quot;How many photos should I have on it? Do I need to hire a professional photographer? Should I wear this dress in it? This dress? Should I stand in front of these flowers?&quot; All sorts of stuff.

I see some real madness in different Facebook groups when it comes to setting up people&#039;s websites. What amazes me, is the people that are always having these fully fledged debates about websites, it&#039;s pretty much a sure fire sign that these people are broke. I just find it quite comical really to see these arguments progress and then just go check out the different people who are getting themselves involved in these conversations. I noticed there&#039;s a huge similarity between all of them, and it&#039;s all that they&#039;re broke, and the reason why they&#039;re broke is because they&#039;re focusing on the wrong thing.

The people are also like, &quot;Do I need a blog? What about a podcast? How can I get my website to look like this one?&quot; People always find a website like Apple, or like, Oprah, and then on their first attempt they&#039;re like, &quot;Well how do I make my website look like Apple&#039;s?&quot; That&#039;s just ... it really is madness. These things aren&#039;t important. However, it really can become addictive to try and match up to other people when it comes to your website and how it looks. It really is an ego thing.

Here&#039;s the truth, it doesn&#039;t matter. Do you think people hire you because your website looks pretty and has cute photos of you in nice dresses on it? I say nice dresses, because I know that women are more likely to fall for this trap then men, but men still fall for it. But I know that women always ... they&#039;re more likely to get caught by this one, because a lot of women put a lot of effort into their websites and they look so pretty.

Do you think people hire you because you managed to waste 70% of your time intervening people for your blog, when you should have been mastering your craft instead. This one is madness. I see people sometimes they&#039;re like, &quot;Oh I need to interview people on my blog. I need to do a podcast. I need to do all of this stuff.&quot; I&#039;m like, and this was a lawyer who was telling me this, and I was like, &quot;Dude, when are you going to be a lawyer? Like, you&#039;re not an interviewer, you&#039;re a lawyer. You&#039;re supposed to be winning cases and helping clients. What the hell are you doing thinking you should start a podcast?&quot; I still couldn&#039;t talk him round, and he ended up doing it and he ended up making less money because of it and becoming a pretty average lawyer.

This is really the truth, but people can&#039;t see it these days. People are blinded by this illusion that being really social and producing a lot of content, and having a fancy looking website and everything, that&#039;s what you should be doing, but really it&#039;s a sure fire sign that the consultant is kind of neglecting their own clients just to work on their own website, which is madness really.

What you&#039;re about to hear will shock you, there is an inverse relationship between fanciness of website and real world business results. By inverse relationship, I mean, if the website is really fancy, you can almost always count that the person&#039;s finances aren&#039;t too fancy. So if someone&#039;s got an awesome looking site, then they&#039;re probably broke. If someone&#039;s got a really fancy website that they&#039;re obsessed with and everything, then they&#039;re probably broke. I look at all of these podcasters and bloggers and everything, and they&#039;ve got like 10 million iTunes downloads, all these other stats, which sound like they&#039;re pretty much like a modern day Oprah or something.

I look at some of their stats, and I&#039;m like, &quot;Ho, my God, there is so many downloads, so many followers, and everything.&quot; I almost get like envious for a second. I&#039;m like, &quot;Whoa, this persons has like figured something out. I need to go look at this.&quot; Then I go look at their blog, and then there&#039;s an income report, and I&#039;m like, &quot;Oh, okay, let&#039;s see how much money this person&#039;s making.&quot; Then I look at the income report and low and behold, they made like a hundred grand for that month. Don&#039;t get me wrong, that&#039;s a lot of money, that is a lot. I congratulate them and everything, but one thing&#039;s for sure, the fame doesn&#039;t correlate to the money. Because these people are so busy building blogs and followings and everything, that comes at the cost of their skills and their ability to get results for their clients.

I&#039;ve really looked at this for a long time. I&#039;ve really tracked a lot of different things. It&#039;s not true in every instance, like pretty much everything, there&#039;s always some outliers, which don&#039;t fit this rule. However, for the most part, I&#039;ve noticed and observed an inverse relationship between the fanciness of website and real world business results. I&#039;ve also observed an inverse relationship between image on social media and real world business results. If someone posts on social medial all the time, and if someone&#039;s always doing Facebook Live, and if someone&#039;s also just an absolute social super star, then you can pretty much count on it, that the financial side of their business isn&#039;t very flesh, it isn&#039;t very good.

It&#039;s almost true in every instance, but again, there&#039;s always some outliers that don&#039;t fit this rule. But you think about it this way, if someone is constantly on their social media channels, well, when are they doing any business work? When are they working on their craft? When are they getting better at what the do? When are they reading books? When are they serving their clients? When are they working on their programs and products and all of these things? That really is the question. If they&#039;re constantly on these things, then how can they be doing anything else?

This really is a huge, huge discovery for a lot of people. I&#039;ve known this for a long time, however, I&#039;m sharing it with you guys now, because I&#039;m sure it will really help you. This is a pin up, which is available for download beneath this video in the resources section. You can download it, print it out, put it on the wall because it&#039;s an important one to remember, because I know a lot of people get sucked in by this one. It says, look rich or be rich, and they are not the same. Everybody has the same amount of time and energy. They also have the choice of where to apply that energy.

If you choose to apply significant energy in the design and content of your website, then that energy is going to be deducted from somewhere else. You just can&#039;t put a ton of energy into your website and your blog and make it all look fancy and your social media and not have better fixed something else. For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction, so if you&#039;re going to add five times of it in one area, that means that five times of it has to be deducted from one other area, or from five areas with equal amounts. Either way there is no way to get around it. If you&#039;re going to make something awesome, then something, or a few things, are going to get less awesome. That&#039;s just how it works.

Really, if someone is awesome at social media and having an awesome website and everything, I&#039;m like, &quot;Where did that come from? Where have they taken that deduction from?&quot; Quite often, you will notice that it comes from their skills, from their products, from the results of their clients, and also from the health and the management of their own business. It&#039;s startling to see, but it really is true. I&#039;ve observed it over a long period of time. Quite often the people who you think are the most successful, just because they&#039;re famous and have a lot of followers and everything, under the hood, things aren&#039;t very good looking and things are troublesome.

If you choose to apply significant energy to your social media accounts and public image, that energy is going to be deducted from something else. There&#039;s an inverse relationship between image and actual. Most entrepreneurs battle with the decision to look successful or be successful. It really is a decision you have to make. Do you want to look successful and get praise from everyone else? Don&#039;t get me wrong, it&#039;s pretty funny, it&#039;s addictive. I had to delete my Instagram and I had to pretty much delete all social media because it even makes me kind of addicted to it.

If I post something and I get a whole bunch of likes, it&#039;s like, I want to keep looking at it, I want to post more stuff, I want to get more of those likes. Then I kind of slap myself, and I&#039;m like, &quot;Wait a minute dude, what the hell are you doing? These are just some likes, these are just some pixels. Who cares? Let&#039;s forget about all of this nonsense, and actually do something worthwhile. Let&#039;s master our craft. Let&#039;s get customers. Let&#039;s help our customers. Let&#039;s change their lives. Let&#039;s make a whole bunch of money and let&#039;s do that stuff, instead of just the likes and everything.&quot; Because I know one is a lot more solid than the other, and I&#039;d rather go for the solid one.

To be honest with you guys, I would rather be successful, then just look successful. I don&#039;t care if lots of people don&#039;t think I&#039;m rich, I&#039;d rather just be rich. You really have to decide whether you want it to be an image, and if you want it to be optics, or whether you want to actually be real. I&#039;m guessing my most people want it to be real. What you need to do is really just forget about that other stuff, you don&#039;t need to not do it at all, but just be comfortable with the fact that it doesn&#039;t need to be this amazing superstar show. You can put all of your effort into the main things. You really just want to keep the main thing the main thing.

Over on the right here, there&#039;s this awesome diagram, which shows basically everyone has the same amount of energy and time. No one else has more time or anything, because it&#039;s just that&#039;s the limit that we all have. You can see these arrows here, if someone is focusing on all of these different things, let&#039;s say a blog, a podcast, a t-shirt business, all of these different things, then if they are giving all the energy they&#039;ve got, then each one of these different things they&#039;re doing is going out this far. They&#039;re making this much progress on all of these different things, right?

But then if you had this other person over here, on the right, and they just chose to neglect everything, but go all in on one thing, let&#039;s say they went all in on their consulting business and they forgot about their blog, they forgot about their YouTube, they forgot about all these different things, which is pretty much like what I did, neglected everything, just went, &quot;Screw it, I&#039;m going to focus on mastering my craft. I&#039;m going to focus on building the best programs that there are, and I&#039;m work on getting my people results and I&#039;m just going to focus on that. I don&#039;t care what anyone says. I don&#039;t care if anyone thinks I&#039;m making a mistake or anything, because I know these are the most important things.

If you were to put all of that energy from the left diagram, if you were to stack all of those arrows up on top of each other, it would look like that. That&#039;s what happens when you focus. You have that much progress compared to an evenly distributed mediocre progress. That&#039;s how you win. It doesn&#039;t matter what your social media looks like, when you&#039;re actually really good at what you do. You&#039;ll notice a lot of pro athletes, they don&#039;t do social media. You&#039;ll notice a lot of the novice athletes, they&#039;re on social media all the time. It&#039;s because some of the novices, they care more about how they look, and how they&#039;re perceived by the public, and they&#039;re always on social media, but then the real killers, the real best athletes, they don&#039;t even touch it, because all they want to do is win, and then walk away and that&#039;s it. They don&#039;t care about anything else.

Ironically, you&#039;ll actually build more of an image, and more of a reputation if all you do is that. But these other people somehow seem to want to waste a lot of time on that other stuff. You&#039;ll notice, like, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Christian Bale, and some of the top actors in the world right now, they don&#039;t really have much of a social media or public image or anything. They pretty much disappear, and they&#039;re invisible. Then they release just like a blockbuster movie and they&#039;re the best actors there in the world, and then they just disappear again. That&#039;s what real professionals do. They don&#039;t care about how they look. They don&#039;t care about the optics or the image or anything, they just focus on their craft, come out and produce some awesome work and then disappear again.

That&#039;s really an important lesson when it comes to this stuff, because I know a lot of entrepreneurs feel like they have to keep up the appearance, and they have to keep up the image. If you want an example, just to show you that I eat my own cooking with this sort of stuff, just look at my website. It looks horrible, it hasn&#039;t been updated in forever, it doesn&#039;t work on a mobile phone properly, it really is quite shocking. Why it&#039;s like that, is because I neglected it to put all of my effort and energy in it to my craft, and to being the best I can at this, and into my customers, my programs, all of those things.

While someone might think, &quot;Oh, Sam, he doesn&#039;t know what he&#039;s doing, because his website looks bad.&quot; Well I don&#039;t really care because I know I&#039;m putting it into things that are more important than that. You should adopt that same way of thinking too, because in the long run, it&#039;ll always win. There is no instance where the other one will win. Over the long term, the other one will always get taken out by this one. One is a fundamentally better strategy than the other. While one of them might appear to be more awesome in the short term, don&#039;t worry, the tables will turn and the other one will prevail.

With that lesson in mind, I created a simple website template that you can set up and go live with in one hour or less. Yes, I really mean that, like we can set your website up, get it live and everything in one hour or less. Let&#039;s take a look. Here is the simple consulting website. I&#039;ll give you a demo of it right now so you can check it out and see what it looks like. If you go on your computer to samovensdemo.com, that is the domain name I used to set it up, and this here is just a demo to show you what it looks like, how it works, and everything. You can see it&#039;s got a black navbar across the top, it&#039;s got my name, it&#039;s got about, content, blog, free case study, it&#039;s got my I help statement. It&#039;s got an image of me, a description button for free case study, it&#039;s got copyright information, privacy and terms, it&#039;s got some navigation at the bottom. Basically this website is ... I&#039;ve created this.

I&#039;ve made it available for you to download with just one click. You can install this website template with one click and in less than one hour, you can make it your own, and you can get it live on your own domain name. The reason why we want to do this is we really want to just cut the time and the nonsense and the waste that I see a lot of people doing when it comes to websites. I&#039;m sick of people just talking about ... like wasting all of this time on their website, when it&#039;s just not that important. There&#039;s more important things that you should be doing than worrying about this.

This website here, it looks fine, I mean, it&#039;s not going to win a design award of the year, but it&#039;s fine, because that&#039;s not we&#039;re trying to win anyway. But it works, it&#039;s simple, it gets the message across. It also works on a mobile phone. You can see here, it&#039;s responsive and everything, it&#039;s fast, it&#039;s just what you need. It&#039;s got an about page, which is obviously about you and your business. It&#039;s got a contact page, it&#039;s even got a blog function. I loaded in three basic articles, which you can edit to be your own. If you click in on these articles, it shows you them in more detail with an image, a headline, the text, see it&#039;s about the author, it&#039;s even got a comments function.

This is a proper, functioning website, with a blog and everything. It even has a call to action, which is the free case study, which leads into your fragmentation funnel. So that if people come to your website, let&#039;s say you send out a direct outreach email, someone can see what email domain you&#039;re using, so if I send out a direct outreach email and it says, <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="dcafbdb19cb3aab9b2afbfb3b2afa9b0a8b5b2bbf2bfb3b1">[email&#160;protected]</a>, well, someone might check out my website, ovensconsulting.com to see what I&#039;m all about. Then if they&#039;re interested, well, we might hook them with this free case study and then they might opt in here, and they might watch the video, like what they hear, and then schedule an appointment with us.

It&#039;s a properly designed website, and it actually looks better than my one right now. I built this all out for you, and it&#039;s pretty funny, because it&#039;s better than mine. I put more effort into this website for you guys then I did into my own website. That again comes back to that thing, which I said before, about how I put more effort into my clients and my programs and their results than I do into my own image, because I know one&#039;s more important than the other. That is the website. It&#039;s also got a privacy policy and terms that you can just edit, so that it can work for you. It&#039;s got everything you need to really go live and have your own website in less than one hour.

If you want to check that out on your own computer, it&#039;s samovensdemo.com. To download this template, you go to consulting.com/clickfunnels. I&#039;ll just grab this here, this link ... So you can go to this inside your website, inside your browser, consulting.com/clickfunnels, and you&#039;ll see here, it says, create your website funnels with one click. It says we partnered with ClickFunnels to bring you everything you need installable with one click.

Before in my previous training programs, it was kind of complicated and technical to set up funnels. I know that put some people off. It was still pretty easy to do, but it still put some people off. This time around, I decided to remove all the friction, and all the possible obstacles that I could, and so I partnered up with ClickFunnels, and I designed all of these funnels and websites and everything myself. It took me probably three or four days to do, like 15 hour days, so I put a lot of time into this thing. I really thoroughly checked everything and set it up exactly how I would if it was my own. In fact, it&#039;s better than my own right now.

Don&#039;t think these are just some junky funnels or anything, I mean, these are really good, they&#039;re actually better than mine. What you want to do is go to consulting.com/clickfunnels, then click on install your funnels. If you already have a ClickFunnels account, click Yes I Do, if you don&#039;t, just click No I Don&#039;t, then you will be able to register for a ClickFunnels account. If you already have one, then you go Yes I Do, just enter in some info here, so I could just type this in, Install My Templates, then it will take you to this page here, which will show you your templates. It says install our funnels directly into your account. Congrats on your new ClickFunnels account, it&#039;s time to load your funnels in.

You can download the consulting website here. It&#039;s number one on the page. You can view a live demo, and you can see it&#039;s a full website, 10 pages, best practice, mobile responsive, everything. All you do is just click Install Template. Once you&#039;ve created your ClickFunnels account, or if you&#039;ve already got one, select I&#039;ve Already Got One, then just click Install Template, and it will load it right into your ClickFunnels account with one click. Simple as that.

Then there&#039;s also these other templates and funnels, which I&#039;ve created for you, which we&#039;ll get to soon in to the training, like the fragmentation funnel. We covered some of these other ones earlier in the organic attraction methods module in this week&#039;s training. But in this video today, we&#039;re going to cover the consulting website, and the fragmentation funnel. You want to install it there. Now let&#039;s talk about how to set up your website step-by-step in less than one hour regardless of your tech-ability. It doesn&#039;t matter if your 16 years old, doesn&#039;t matter if you&#039;re 90, doesn&#039;t matter what your level of tech is, it doesn&#039;t matter if you type at like one word per minute.

These step-by-step instructions are really thorough and I&#039;ve really gone out of my way to remove any obstacle from this. I can make sure that everyone has the ability to get their website live and get their funnels and everything live. I put together some simple instructions and I&#039;m going to show them to you right now. Now this is the second task that we have set for you when it comes to assembling the war machine. This one is setting up your website.

This is a basic cheat sheet, or list of instructions, which is available for download beneath this video in the resources section. I&#039;m going to pull this one up right now on my computer, show you what it looks like. We&#039;ll just take a brief, sort of, look through this, but we won&#039;t go in too much detail, because you can go in and drill down into these yourself. When you&#039;re going through this, and you want to set this stuff up yourself, download this cheat sheet and follow the instructions yourself. There&#039;s also some videos in here as well. That&#039;s how you really drill down and get into the granular step-by-step stuff. Like I said, this video&#039;s just a 30,000 foot view and really explains the benefits and everything.

At the top we&#039;ve got a basic introduction, what this is, why it&#039;s important, all of that stuff. Then, we basically give you two options for this, you can watch the video tutorial, which will walk you through the entire process in a video, just like the one you&#039;re watching now if you prefer videos. So you can click this, or click here if you want to watch that. However, if you&#039;re a person that prefers text instructions, then we&#039;ve got these here for you as well. We&#039;ll just briefly look over these. It shows you to download the funnels, open it up, and then you start editing the different pages, like the home page, you change the logo with your logo, and the cool thing is this time round, is that you don&#039;t even need a logo.

All you do, is you type your name in. When we go to samovensdemo.com, and you see my logo here, that isn&#039;t a logo, it&#039;s text. As you can see here, as I&#039;m circling, as I&#039;m highlighting this, it&#039;s not an image, it&#039;s text. All you have to do is type in your name. If you were editing this in ClickFunnels, you could change it to Bob Jones or whatever. I think in the beginning no one should even worry about making a logo. It doesn&#039;t matter. The truth is, is I made my logo, Sam Ovens, using Keynote, so it&#039;s just text. I just opened up Keynote on my computer, and I typed the words Sam Ovens, and then I just tried out like six or seven different fonts inside Keynote and I found one that looked good, so I took a screen shot of it. That was my logo. Cost zero dollars. Cost me less than two minutes of time. I made more than 18 million dollars with that business. You don&#039;t need anything fancy.

We&#039;re getting a little bit more fancy now with consulting.com, but that&#039;s only now, like five, six years in, after making a lot of money. It&#039;s also hugely painful to go through that process. Even though we can easily afford it now, and we have the resources and everything, it slows you down. It bogs you down, and it really is a waste of your time. There is way more important places that you could be placing your time and resources other than coming up with a logo.

Then you basically edit the different pages, like you change the headline, you change the text, you change the image of me, you put an image of you. Now when it comes to putting in an image of you, you don&#039;t need to get a fancy photographer or anything, you might already have an image of you available on your computer. Or you might have one on Facebook that you can use, and that&#039;ll do.

However, if you don&#039;t have any photos of you, well, just get your friend, or your partner, or your mom or something, just to take one of you, just standing next to something, like it&#039;s that simple. You don&#039;t need to get all fancy with this stuff. The photo I&#039;ve got on my website, samovens.com, my girlfriend took that of me, and it&#039;s nothing fancy, and it&#039;s like four years old, or some ... no not four, it&#039;s like two and a bit years old. That&#039;s all it is. It really is that simple. I&#039;ve been able to make all of this money and everything with it.

Fancy websites are not the reason why people are successful. More often than not, they&#039;re actually the reason why people are unsuccessful, so just keep that in mind. Then you edit these other pages. You edit the blog pages and all of that. It&#039;s important to have a couple of blog posts or three, I don&#039;t think anymore than three, that&#039;s why I&#039;ve made the template to include three. It&#039;s just enough to show that you&#039;re professional and established. I&#039;ve put these things in brackets, because I don&#039;t really think these things make you professional or established. However, they make you appear professional and established, and not really to a smart person, but a normal person who takes these things worth, like, credibility, when they&#039;re not really.

We&#039;re just basically doing the bare minimum to sort of satisfy most people&#039;s opinions when it comes to this sort of stuff. We don&#039;t want to be flying to low below the radar when it comes to public opinion on this stuff, because while everyone might be wrong, we still want to kind of satisfy the basic requirements. That&#039;s what we&#039;re doing by having three posts. It also makes us compliant for doing Facebook ads and those other things, because Facebook likes to see that there&#039;s some content on your website, so does Google, so do your clients, it shows that it&#039;s not just a fly by night company. It also shows that you&#039;ve got a bit of depth when it comes to your site, and also shows you that you know a few things.

You want to come up with three posts. They should be at least 500 words each and they should include an image that is relevant to the topic that you&#039;re writing about. If you need help coming up with ideas, I&#039;ve given you a link here, which takes you to a good article on how to come up with blog ideas. That&#039;ll help you come up some blog ideas, I mean, we only need three. Then you can write those yourself, it&#039;s good practice, because it&#039;s getting you used to creating content and trying to help your prospective clients in your marketplace, so it&#039;s good practice.

Then, what we do, is we link up your ClickFunnels account to your domain name so that it&#039;s actually published on your domain name, whether that&#039;s ovensconsulting.com or whatever. There&#039;s video instructions on how to do that. Then we show you how to set up the domain path and all of this stuff, again, there&#039;s video instructions. Then we edit the navigation links and all of that, and then we do some thorough testing. Then we go live. Once it&#039;s live, we basically test it some more. We get a friend or someone to test it. We can get someone else in the group if we know them, in the Facebook group, if we already know them, to test it out. We make sure that everything&#039;s working fine. I&#039;m not going to dive into huge detail with this, because you can go in and find all of this information yourself and work through these instructions step-by-step yourself. I&#039;ve left no stone unturned in any of these. That is how you set up your website.

Now, number three the third part of six when assembling the war machine. That is setting up your business email and calendar. There&#039;s an interesting story behind this one. In all of the training programs I&#039;ve created, I&#039;ve always assumed that people know how to set up an email account to send from their domain name. Example, <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="bbd1d4d3d5fbd1d1d8d4d5c8ced7cfd2d5dc95d8d4d6">[email&#160;protected]</a>, so you can see that&#039;s @acompany.com. It&#039;s not @gmail.com, or @hotmail.com, or @yahoo. However, it was fascinating to see that most people were sending direct outreach emails to prospective clients using personal email accounts. For example, <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="80eaefe8eee2edf8b1b7c0e7ede1e9ecaee3efedae">[email&#160;protected]</a> I&#039;ve seen worse, I&#039;ve seen <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="c6b6afa8adb5b2a3a3b4afa8a1b1aea3a3aaf7ff86aea9b2aba7afaae8a5a9abe8">[email&#160;protected]</a>

I think I&#039;ve seen some aol&#039;s.com. I don&#039;t even know if AOL works anymore. Those are sorts of things you don&#039;t want to do. If you&#039;re trying to be ahead of your market and if you&#039;re trying to really show that you know your stuff and you&#039;re still using a AOL email, it&#039;s not a good look. Neither is Yahoo, or Hotmail, or any of these things. Even just a basic Gmail one, any established business person or consultant should have their own one. It&#039;s not just the appearance of it, it&#039;s also just the pure functionality of it. It&#039;s much more efficient to have your own email and separate personal from business.

The advantages for you, regardless of what the perception might be from your marketplace, are worth it alone, so it&#039;s definitely worth doing. Is it essential to have an email using your own domain? No. You can use your Gmail, or Yahoo, whatever, and you&#039;ll still be able to get clients with it. It&#039;s not mandatory, it&#039;s not essential. However, the benefits gained from having one verse the very small time and cost to set it up, makes it an easy win. You know, in business, you&#039;re always looking at the symmetry between cost/time verse benefit. You&#039;re always looking at what&#039;s the upside, and then, what&#039;s the downside. You&#039;re looking for asymmetrical relationships between the two things. Well at least that&#039;s what good business men are doing.

You&#039;re looking at things, and you&#039;re like, &quot;Okay, well, if I do this thing, how much do I stand to gain from it?&quot; Then you look at the benefits, okay? Then, to do this thing and get these benefits, what do I have to put myself through? What&#039;s the cost? What&#039;s the time? What&#039;s the stress? What&#039;s the whatever it is? Because no gain really comes with no loss, but you&#039;re looking for a gain that&#039;s larger than the loss. With the amount of time it takes to set up a business email, which is pretty much less than 10 minutes and the cost which is $5 a month, it makes this one a no brainer. It makes this one very awesome. It&#039;s got huge upside, it costs pretty much nothing, and it&#039;s a one off seed and it&#039;s cheap. It&#039;s just a no brainer to do.

What are the benefits, you&#039;re probably thinking. Like, it&#039;s just an email account, what do I stand to gain. Here are the benefits of using business email from your own domain name. When you&#039;re sending out direct outreach emails, or other business emails to prospective clients, they are more likely to take you seriously, reply to your emails and sign up as a client and pay you money if you&#039;re using an email from your own domain name. It just shows that you&#039;re more established. It shows that you&#039;re serious. It shows you know what you&#039;re doing. When you&#039;re sending emails out to people, they&#039;re able to see what your website is, because it&#039;s coming from your own domain name, then people can look up your domain.

This is my second point, is prospective clients able to see your website at the end of your email address, which means they will check out your website and see what you have to offer? You get to separate all of your personal email from your business email, which allows you to stay organized and focused when working on your business. I see some people they have like 7,000 unread emails in their email inbox. That&#039;s bad enough, but how on earth is someone going to run a business out of that thing.

If someone sends you an email, it&#039;s going to get lost in there. That sort of stuff, it&#039;s just too messy, you&#039;re not going to be able to keep a clear head, you&#039;re not going to be able to focus, you&#039;re certainly not going to be able to run your business efficiently. That sort of sloppiness needs to get sorted out. You need to create a separate email account with your own domain name, put business stuff in one, personal stuff in the other. You can use Google Calendar, Google Drive and Gmail, all from one simple login from any device when you set up your business email account the way I&#039;m about to show you.

This makes running your business more efficient and organized, compared to using four or five different systems. I see some people they&#039;ve got a calendar here, then they&#039;ve got their email on this other thing, and then they&#039;ve got their storage on this other thing, it&#039;s all disconnected, and it&#039;s all a mess. It&#039;s pretty much already broken, however, when you start to apply some stress to this thing, it&#039;s really going to break. It&#039;s a good idea right now, while things are still nice and civil in your business, because you don&#039;t have a huge amount of demand, to make sure these sorts of systems are set up correctly.

To some people, this might just sound so simple, because you&#039;ve already got it set up, but think about what your life was like before you knew how to set this up. It&#039;s like night and day difference. I want to show everyone how to do this. This is how you do it. It really is a no brainer decision. I put together some simple instructions, showing you how to set up your business email with GSuite. GSuite is what Gmail calls their business email platform. Here is how you set up your business email and calendar.

To show you how to set all this stuff up, I&#039;ve included all of the instructions on this cheat sheet available for download beneath this video, it&#039;s called 3. Setting up your biz email. We&#039;ll go ahead and pull this up on the screen right now and show you what it looks like, and have a little walk through it. Setting up your business email and calendar. There&#039;s a little introduction about it at the top. If you prefer a video tutorial, you can watch a video, it takes you through the whole thing. If you prefer text instructions, well, we can use text. You go the the GSuite website, and create a new account.

I can go to this right now, I can go show you what GSuite looks like, just looks like this. You get Gmail, Docs, Drive and Calendar for business. For business means we can set it all up on your own domain name. It can be like, ovensconsulting.com. You can have that set up through GSuite. You can log in to Gmail using that. To do this, you just go Get Started and you just follow the instructions on the page. You just go step-by-step through it. It only costs ... you get a 14 day free trial, and then after that it costs you five bucks a month. It&#039;s definitely worth it.

The benefits you stand to gain from it, are worth way more than five bucks a month, seriously. During the set up process it will ask you for your company name and domain name. Make sure you enter these correctly. Your company name will be like, Ovens Consulting, or whatever, and then your domain name might be ovensconsulting.com. This is what we did in the first process, which was choosing a name and a domain name. Whatever you selected back there and registered with Namecheap, that&#039;s what you enter into GSuite when you&#039;re going through the process.

When it asks you what you would like your email to be, just make it first name at ... Sorry I just clicked on the wrong thing. Make it your <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="eb8d8299955f858a834eab54849e998f84834a8285858a834ec5548486c5">[email&#160;protected]</a> Try to keep everything in your business as simple as possible. You don&#039;t want to leave any room for error, and you don&#039;t want to add complexity anywhere, because, believe me, over time, the complexity stacks up and it gets out of control. It&#039;s important from the very first brick that you lay, with your business, that you keep it simple, because if you don&#039;t, you&#039;ll have to come back to it later, and it&#039;s going to be big mess when you come back to it later. So don&#039;t have a really fancy email, don&#039;t even go your first name dot your last name, just keep it simple like <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="6013010d201408051408090e07">[email&#160;protected]</a>, at your domain name.

Once you have set up your GSuite account, it&#039;ll ask you to connect your domain name to the GSuite email servers. This is the only part that&#039;s a little bit technical. It&#039;s still extremely easy, because I&#039;ve created a video tutorial, which you can watch here. Then after you set it all up and you&#039;ve got it connected to the email servers, you can do a test to make sure it&#039;s working, and then you&#039;re ready to go. You now have a Gmail account, which has @yourdomainname.com, which is the best system that you can possibly use in the entire world right now, you&#039;ll be at the forefront of all of this stuff. You&#039;ll also know what you&#039;re doing. You&#039;re probably further ahead than a lot of your clients ... a lot of your competitors.

I have a lot of people who I work with, even lawyers and stuff, and they still run their own email server at their office. I&#039;m like, &quot;Man, where have you guys been? You guys been asleep for like 10 years or something.&quot; Because their email server even goes down, like it dies and they have to call me and be like, &quot;Sorry, we can&#039;t see an email for like two or three days, because our server&#039;s down.&quot; This is the sort of stuff that you&#039;d be surprised how many people still haven&#039;t evolved and moved to this new technology.

While it might sound real simple, you&#039;re still getting massive advantage from this. Once you&#039;ve got it set up, you can use Gmail, Google Calendar, and Google Drive, all with that one login, which means that you&#039;ve only got one thing to remember and you&#039;ve got access to all of those things. When it comes to running your consulting business, I recommend you use Gmail for all of your email. I recommend you use Google Calendar for all of your calendaring stuff, your strategy sessions and everything, this is what you should connect to schedule once, which is our scheduling tool. I recommend you use Google Drive for sharing and storing all of your files.

When it comes to saving your files, your worksheets, your client work, all of that stuff, don&#039;t save it on your computer, because your computer might get lost, it might get stolen, it might break. The chances of one of those three things happening are extremely high, so don&#039;t do that. Make sure you save everybody in Google Drive. You get a whole bunch of free storage anyway, and then it&#039;s accessible from everywhere. That way, you&#039;ve got all of those things in your entire business pretty much set up with these three things. Even in consulting.com, my business today, all of our staff all use Google Drive, Google Calendar and Gmail, that&#039;s pretty much it. With that, we can pretty much run our entire company. These are three very powerful tools. If you want a quick demonstration about how these work, you can watch a video there. We recommend bookmarking these three icons for easy access.

Once you&#039;ve done that, congratulations, you&#039;ve gone ahead and set up your business email and your calendar using GSuite. While that might sound simple for some people, imagine what your life was like before you found all of that stuff. Sometimes us people who are a little bit more tech savvy and who have had these things for a while, we tend to think nothing of them, but when I see a lot of people using AOL and Hotmail and things, I just, I&#039;m kind of in shock. That&#039;s why I wanted to include this in this training.

Now, number four, step four of six when assembling the war machine. This is setting up your fragmentation funnel. Do you remember what our fragmentation funnel is? We had talked about it earlier in week four, when we were doing the organic and paid attraction methods. This is our fragmentation funnel, it&#039;s also our paid client acquisition and attraction method. We start off with Facebook ads, and that&#039;s how we drive traffic. Someone might see one of our Facebook ads, they click on it, then they come to a landing page where they enter in their email address to get access to a case study, then after they enter in their email, they see a value video. This is just a basic value video, which hooks someone in with a good headline and everything, and then it kicks their bruised knee, makes them feel some pain, really agitates their situation a bit. Then it shows them three or four quick tips to really help solve some of their problems and prove that you&#039;re an authority and an expert in this niche, and know all your prospects pain.

Then at the end, it gets your prospect to reach out for additional information by requesting a strategy session if they would like more help. That&#039;s what a lot of them do. Then when they reach out for more help, they schedule into your calendar using the software which we have and that directly hooks into Google Calendar, which is awesome, that&#039;s why we set up GSuite in the previous step, goes straight into Google Calendar, the email notifications you get goes straight into your Gmail. Then they fill out a survey and that survey basically has a bunch of different questions and it asks your prospects all these different things, so that you can really look at them and triage them and be like, &quot;Can I help this person or can I not?&quot; And, &quot;Is this person a good fit? Or are they not?&quot;

You want to basically come up with a basic sort of decision making criteria when it comes to who to reject and who not to reject. You want to be rejecting at least 10% or at 10 - 20% of applications, because there&#039;s always going to be a bit of dead weight in those applications. You never want to just be accepting everything, you always want to have a policy to trim that. Then you accept the ones which look good, you get on a call with them, you have a sales call, you walk them through the sales script and our methodology for all of that stuff. Then at the end, some of them buy, some of them don&#039;t. Then the ones that do buy, obviously they become a customer.

To show you what the fragmentation funnel looks like, you can check it out here, by going to samovensdemo.com. Then all you need to do is click Free Case Study. It will take you to the fragmentation funnel. It says, Get Your Case Study Now, so if I go ahead and if I enter my information in here, so if I go ... enter this in, the next step is to watch the value video, which we call the case study video here, they watch this video, it walks them through everything. Then they apply now to see if they qualify. They click this. Takes them through to the scheduling page, where they can see our availability and our calendar.

Like I said, this scheduling technology connects directly to our Google Calendar, so it can see our availability and feed back right here and get our prospective clients to see what we have available and they can schedule an appointment. Then they enter in all their info. Then they enter in their phone number. Then the next step is, once they&#039;ve done that, it says Step 2 of 2, Please Complete This Quick Survey To Reserve Your Free Strategy Session. They fill out this information here, first name, last name, email, call preference, Skype ID or phone number, current monthly revenue and all of this stuff.

Now obviously, I&#039;m in the business of helping people make more money and that&#039;s what I do, that&#039;s my area of expertise, that&#039;s what I understand. Now, if your line of business and if your niche and offer and message and everything isn&#039;t to do with money, it&#039;s to do with health or yoga or weight loss or getting dates or having a nice wardrobe or anything like that, then obviously you change the questions around. All we&#039;re really trying to do here, is get an understanding of their current situation and what they want their desired situation to be.

When I&#039;m asking for their current situation, I&#039;m asking questions like current monthly revenue. Then when I&#039;m looking for desired situation, I&#039;m looking at target monthly revenue. Then I&#039;m looking for the obstacle, what&#039;s stopping them from getting where they want to go? What&#039;s really the thing which is hindering them from bridging the gap themself. That&#039;s why I say what do you feel is your biggest obstacle? Then I get some information about their business. Then I have this question to sort of gage how much money they have, or whether they&#039;ve got nothing. If they go, &quot;I don&#039;t have any financial resources.&quot; I&#039;m probably going to cancel their call, because there&#039;s just no point in us talking.

If you are accepted, how soon can you get started? This is a question to really gage the urgency. Obviously the shorter the time frame they put here, the better. It&#039;s something to worry about if they put six months or something here. I like this last question, finally what makes you different from the other applicants and why should we work with you? This is a question that really flips the script on them. A lot of people, when they&#039;re filling out forms and looking to buy from a consultant or something, they believe that they have all the power and that they&#039;re going to be the ones picking and choosing. However, when we ask this question, it flips it back. We&#039;re like, &quot;Hey, you try sell us.&quot; It&#039;s very powerful. It gives that authority and it gives us that alpha role and it really starts turning the tables before the call has even started, which is a very powerful thing to do psychologically. That&#039;s why we have that question there.

Then they go ahead and they book their free strategy session. I&#039;m just going to put some info in here, obviously if someone gave you some data like this, you&#039;d cancel their call. Then when you do this, it takes us through to a success page, which says, &quot;Awesome your strategy session is scheduled.&quot; It says what to expect on the upcoming call and everything. Now all of these pages look really good, they look better than my current funnel right now, which has made me more than a million bucks, and they are mobile responsive. This is everything you need and more really.

Like is said, these pages and the design and technology in this funnel is better than my own, and it&#039;s better than some of my seven figure students. Probably better than most of theirs. Don&#039;t feel like this stuff isn&#039;t the real deal, or the best stuff, it really is better than the stuff we use ourselves. We have given you all of that stuff available for download pretty much with one click. That is our paid attraction method, and that&#039;s our fragmentation funnel.

Facebook ads are not the only way somebody can get into our fragmentation funnel. People can opt in to it from our website too. Remember when we looked at the website before? It has buttons and links all over it that say Free Case Study. At the top in the navigation bar on all of the pages, it says Free Case Study, you can see that top right. On a lot of the pages, it has a blue button that says Free Case Study. Then on all of the pages in the navigation bar at the bottom it says Free Case Study, bottom right. What we&#039;re trying to do is we&#039;re tying to pick up some traffic from really other sources.

In the beginning I know a lot of people won&#039;t be doing Facebook ads and that&#039;s good, that&#039;s the right thing to do. You shouldn&#039;t touch that stuff until you&#039;ve established proof of concept, got at least a few clients, started to make some money, and really started to understand things. Then once we have that proof of concept we go to Facebook and that&#039;s how we apply gas the pilot flame and scale. However, we want to include some links to our fragmentation funnel on our website, because as we are sending direct outreach emails, it&#039;s going to have sort of a domino effect. What I mean by that is, you might send out say 50 direct outreach emails, and only some people might reply to you, but a lot of people are going to look at those emails.

Let&#039;s say you send out 50 emails, let&#039;s say only five people reply, well, let&#039;s say 30 of those 50 actually opened the email and took a look. Well, what might happen, is people are real nosy. They always like to check stuff out, but just kind of remain anonymous. I know you&#039;re probably thinking right now, yeah, that&#039;s true, because I do that. That&#039;s because all humans are like that. When we&#039;re sending direct outreach emails from our business email account, people can see that it says @samovens.com or @ovensconsulting.com. Then people quite often, they&#039;re like, &quot;Okay well, I&#039;m going to go check that out.&quot; They enter that into their browser and they pull up your website. They have a look and they read about you. They see what you&#039;re all about, then this free case study call to action on all the pages and everything, it&#039;s kind of like a hook or a piece of bait, that can really hook those prospects in from another angle.

If we send out a direct outreach email, if someone doesn&#039;t reply to us there, we can still reel them in from this way, even though it&#039;s indirect. If we send out lump email, a lot of people might open our lump email, read it, and then they&#039;re going to go to our website and check it out. While they might not respond to our specific marketing piece, they might get hooked into our funnel from one of these other angles. The same thing goes with pretty much everything you do.

If you do a webinar, when you&#039;re doing Facebook ads, when you&#039;re doing anything, there&#039;s always going to be sort of a ripple effect that you will notice. You want to have some hooks to pick up that ripple effect from other indirect places. The best place to pick up that ripple effect is right on your website with a nice simple call to action like this. That&#039;s why I included the free case study call to action on the website template, which I&#039;ve provided you with. I do recommend you use it. It will pick up some strategy sessions, and it will pick up some clients.

At this stage you don&#039;t have to set up your fragmentation funnel, that decision is totally up to you. Like I said, in the setting up your website training, if you want to, you can. If you don&#039;t want to, you don&#039;t need to worry about it, all you need to do is delete the free case study buttons and links from your website. In the, I think it was, the second part of the assembling the war machine training today, we talked about setting up your website with our template. The template has these buttons in it, which show free case study.

Now, if you want to set up the fragmentation funnel, you&#039;re more than welcome to. You can follow the instructions and everything to do that, and then you can just leave these buttons as is, and you just link them up to your fragmentation funnel, that&#039;s it. However, if you&#039;re not going to be doing your fragmentation funnel right now, it&#039;s fine, you don&#039;t have to do it, it&#039;s not mandatory. If you&#039;re pressed for time right now, or if you see it as a massive challenge, then don&#039;t worry about it, you can do it later, but you&#039;ll want to delete these links and buttons from your website, because otherwise people are going to see these and they&#039;re going to try and click on them and everything, and they&#039;re not going to get anything, and people don&#039;t like it when that stuff happens. If you&#039;re not going to roll out the fragmentation funnel, make sure you delete these from your site.

The training on setting up your website covers that in detail. It&#039;s your decision whether you set up the fragmentation funnel or not. It&#039;s totally up to you. I&#039;ve seen successful students take both options. It&#039;s not like, all the successful people do the fragmentation funnel, and none of the successful people don&#039;t do it. It really is just an even split really. I mean, it totally depends on you, your situation, how much time you&#039;ve got all of that stuff. There&#039;s not one right and one wrong option here. It really is your decision. If it was something which was really extremely important, believe me, I would tell you you must do it, because I&#039;m not in the business of giving the wrong advice, so it is an option.

However, if you do want my personal opinion, like I&#039;ve told you it doesn&#039;t matter, but if you want to know what my personal opinion is on this thing, I do recommend setting it up, because it will force you to clarify your message and offer, and this will sharpen your teeth, ready for the sales calls. It&#039;s awesome when you force yourself to create something like a value video and a fragmentation funnel, because right now, you&#039;ve got an understanding in your head, all these different ideas and things bouncing around, which is great, but when you go to create a value video, or some slides or something like that, it really forces you to crystallize your message and your offer and your understanding.

You have to put into words, you have to put it on paper. When you do that, it sharpens it right up. It really sharpens you up too, because when you are forced to clarify your message and offer and everything like that, it improves your understanding, which means that when you get on the sales calls and everything and when you start getting clients, you&#039;re going to be better at it. You always want to look at ways where you can improve. I can tell you, with 100% certainty and conviction, if you do the fragmentation funnel right now, and if you set up the value video and everything, it will make you a better sales person and it will exponentially increase your chances of landing a client and making some money. That&#039;s my opinion on the topic.

If you want to set up your fragmentation funnel now, or sometime in the future, I&#039;ve put together step-by-step instructions so that you can glide through the entire process with ease. Let&#039;s take a look. This is the fragmentation funnel. Like I said, if you want to view a demo of this to see what it&#039;s like, walk through it yourself, you can go to samovensdemo.com, and then just click the Free Case Study button. Then you can opt in there and go through it and see what it&#039;s like. You can go through it yourself. You can see the real thing.

Then, if want to go ahead and install it, install the template, we&#039;ve made it available with one click. To do that you go to consulting.com/clickfunnels. The URL is on the page right now. If I go to this, and if I go and open up my browser, paste this in, consulting.com/clickfunnels, create your website funnels with one click. Like I said, we&#039;ve partnered with ClickFunnels to do this. You install your templates, if you don&#039;t have an account, you can create one, if you do have an account, you just enter in your info here.

Then you scroll down to number two on the page, Fragmentation Funnel, you can view the live demo here, you can see the exact info about what you&#039;re going to get, and then you can install it with one click. That will just load it right into your ClickFunnels account, whether that&#039;s an existing one or a brand new one which you set up with us by following the instructions on the page. To do that you go to consulting.com/clickfunnels.

This funnel, it&#039;s, like I said, it&#039;s the real deal. It took me a long time to build out, and I&#039;ve really tested it, refined it, honed it, everything. The design is good, it&#039;s mobile responsive, it looks great, it has all the technology you need. Honestly, in 100% truth, it is better than my funnel. The technology is better, it looks better, it works faster, it&#039;s in every way shape and form better than my actually funnel which has made me more than a million dollars. Rest assured you&#039;re getting the real deal, the real thing when you grab this funnel. That&#039;s where you can get the template and view the live online demo.

Now let&#039;s look at the step-by-step instructions to actually set this thing up for you, because right now it&#039;s just a template. Templates are great and everything, but they don&#039;t make us money, they don&#039;t get us clients, they don&#039;t move the needle, so let&#039;s talk about how to really take this template and turn it into something of your own. This brings us to the fourth point in the assembling the war machine training. This one is setting up your fragmentation funnels, sorry your fragmentation funnel, there&#039;s only one of them.

You can see this is just a cheat sheet, which is available for download beneath this video in the resources section. You can go ahead and download it, it&#039;s just a basic PDF. I&#039;m going to pull it up on my screen right now so you can see what it looks like and we just take a brief scroll through this thing. Says, Setting Up Your Fragmentation Funnel Cheat Sheet. This is available for download beneath the video in the resources section. At the top there&#039;s just a brief intro, tells you what it&#039;s all about. If you prefer videos, like a video tutorial, you can watch the whole video, which shows you step-by-step how to go through it. If you prefer text, we&#039;ve got the text instructions. We&#039;ve really covered all different angles and everything that you could possibly get caught on in this training which you&#039;ve got here.

Like I said, we have left no stone unturned, we&#039;ve made sure that anyone, regardless of their age, tech-ability, budget, anything, can get this stuff set up. There is no reason why anybody can&#039;t. Just to skim over these instructions, you can download the fragmentation funnel at this link here. Then before editing any of the funnels or doing anything, please make sure you follow these instruction carefully. Then I give some warnings here, like not to copy my funnel exactly, because if you do that, then everyone will know, and then people won&#039;t buy from you because it&#039;s not a good look.

You want to make it original. You want to make it your own. You want to put some time into it. Then you create your script and your slides. I show you how to create you slides for your value video. I go into some great detail here, to make sure you can really understand this thoroughly. I give you a lot of resources. There&#039;s also a little video here, which shows you exactly what to do. Then you can look at my live funnel. You can go through it yourself. You can also view my value video yourself. There&#039;s a link there to watch it. Then I&#039;ve given you my slides, the exact slides I used to create this value video. If you want to use PowerPoint, you can use that, otherwise you can use Keynote.

Then I&#039;ve give you my video script, so that&#039;s word for word what I said in that video, and you can get it in a Word file, or you can get it in a Google Doc file here, just with a click. Then, I&#039;ve really given you everything you need so you can go and create these slides. One thing I notice a lot of people saying is, &quot;Where do we get these images from? I don&#039;t want to use images off Google, because what if I get fined or sued or anything?&quot; That&#039;s a good question.

You can use Google Search and you can change the rights to ... you want to change it to free to use/here. I&#039;ll show you real quick what that looks like. If I go to google.com, whoops that&#039;s not the one I want to go to, I&#039;ll go in here. If I go to google.com and then if I search for, let&#039;s say I want to look for a personal trainer image, right? Let&#039;s say I&#039;m in the personal training niche. Well what you do is click on Images, you search for what you want, google.com, then at the top here, you click on settings and then you go to search settings here, sorry that&#039;s not what you do, you go Settings, then you go to Advanced Search, then if you scroll down here, you&#039;ll see Usage Rights.

You want to make sure in here, that you go to Free to Use or Share Even Commercially. This means that any image you find on Google when you&#039;re searching with this filter, is the rights on it are free to use and share even commercially, that means in business. It means that it doesn&#039;t matter what you find with this search filter, everything here is free to use and no one can say anything to you, and even if they did, well it&#039;s Google&#039;s fault not yours, because you applied the filter. You&#039;re totally fine provided you add that filter you find any of these photos you want and you can use them. That is how you can find those images.

What I find is typically, you can find all the photos you want for free. However, if you want to get fancy, you can go to one of those websites where you can buy stock images, but I don&#039;t like stock images, because they just look cheesy and tacky, and everyone knows they&#039;re stock images. I try to avoid those things and just go natural and try find something through Google with this filter applied, and it&#039;s free that way too. That&#039;s how you find the images for your slides.

Then you go ahead and record your video. Once you&#039;ve completed your script and slides and everything, you record it, I tell you different software to use, so if you&#039;re using MAC or PC or if you want a free option. I even tell you two different microphone options to use. With all of these different options, I give you an expensive option and a cheap option, depending on what your budget is. If you really want a good microphone, you would use this ET thing, this thing really is awesome, the sound quality will blow your mind for the price and it&#039;s well worth it.

However, if you&#039;re on a budget, then ... sorry that&#039;s not the one, if you&#039;re on a budget, you want to use this Logitech Clear Chat thing, which is 25 bucks. You just don&#039;t want to not use a good microphone when you&#039;re recording a video, because it just sounds so bad that it actually won&#039;t work. Audio quality is probably the most important thing when it comes to online video. Even slide show videos. When the audio quality is good, people just listen longer, they&#039;re more engaged and everything. It&#039;s so important that you just can&#039;t mess it up. We&#039;ve looked at metrics for everything.

The video can even be screwed up, but the audio can never be screwed up. You can have the best looking video in the world, but if the audio is bad, people are still going to run away. For 25 bucks that&#039;s really as cheap as we get it. You can order these ones from Amazon, the links are all here. Video hosting services, everything you can possibly want to know, it&#039;s all included here in this cheat sheet. Then the whole workflow and process to record this all, I&#039;ve given it all to you here. Step-by-step instructions, everything you need to know. Then editing the funnel pages. Editing all of the content and the images and the videos so that it&#039;s your own. Integrating the scheduling software with Google Calendar and all of that. Everything is available here in this download.

Then I show you how to publish it all to your own domain. Then we go through a thorough testing process. Testing is so important when it comes to funnels, because even the best people I&#039;ve ever seen, they make mistakes. That&#039;s totally fine. It&#039;s actually impossible really to not make a mistake when it comes to setting up funnels. There&#039;s just too many moving parts. There&#039;s too many different nodes and things between all of the different connections in the system for you to do it and not make a mistake. When you set it up, there will be a mistake, you can almost guarantee it. That&#039;s totally fine, provided you check it, you test.

Always make sure you test your stuff online. I&#039;ve see so many people just finish their thing, they&#039;re like, &quot;Why isn&#039;t it working?&quot; I click on it, and I&#039;m like, &quot;Dude, did you even test your own funnel? This is going to a 404 page.&quot; They&#039;re like, &quot;Oh, shit. Sorry, I didn&#039;t look.&quot; It&#039;s like, you just need to test this stuff. Even I test my stuff all the time, vigorously, because I just want to make sure that it&#039;s not broken. I give you a full testing work flow to go through to make sure it&#039;s all working right. Then even a trouble shooting section, so if you have any problems with any of these steps in the setup process, I tell you how to solve in this trouble shooting section.

Like I said, this video which you&#039;re watching right now is kind of like a high level 30,000 foot view about all six parts and how to really assemble the war machine, ready for battle. When you need to drill down and get into the granular step-by-step details for any one of these six steps, you go into the PDFs and deep dive there. I&#039;m just kind of skimming over this now, but if you want to deep dive, you can go into these things. That&#039;s the fragmentation funnel.

Then step five, step five of six when assembling the war machine is registering your business. This is another one of those things that trips people up. See it in the Facebook group, hear it on the Q&amp;A, hear it all the time. I&#039;ve been doing this stuff for quite a long time now, teaching people how to start and grow consulting businesses, that I have the luxury of a lot of data and a lot of feedback. I never really showed people how to do this one, but I know for a fact, that this issue does exist. I know a lot of people grapple with this one.

The thing that people struggle with is how do I register my business? People are brand new sometimes. They&#039;ve been working a job, they&#039;ve never had their own business before, they don&#039;t know how to start one. Sometimes these sorts of decisions and tasks can be a bit daunting, because there&#039;s lots of different options. Also people tell you, &quot;Oh, you must talk to a lawyer.&quot; You should never listen to anyone who&#039;s not a business person about business typically. When I wanted to start my own business, all my friends and family told me, &quot;Oh you need to talk to all these lawyers.&quot; I was freaking out, because I was like, &quot;Man, I&#039;ve only got this small amount of money, it sounds like with all these lawyers I&#039;m going to have to talk to, then I&#039;m not going to have any money left.&quot; I thought this was going to be a big ordeal to set up, but little did I know, the people I was listening to had no idea what they were talking about. They might as well have been speaking Chinese, because they just had no idea.

You&#039;ve got to really develop a filter for who do you listen to and who do you not listen to. The way I filter stuff, is on money. This is only to do with business advice obviously. I don&#039;t judge all people on money, that would be a very bad way to live, but when it comes to business advice, I certainly do that. If someone&#039;s telling me all of this business advice, and they don&#039;t make any money, I&#039;m not listening. If someone&#039;s even telling me I&#039;m making a mistake and they don&#039;t make money, I&#039;m not listening. However, if someone&#039;s got more money than me, and they&#039;re telling me advice, I&#039;m listening. That&#039;s a very good filter to adopt and use for yourself when listening to advice.

I noticed that a lot people, they don&#039;t know how to register their own business. They get confused. They&#039;re like, &quot;Do I need a business in order to start this? Do I get an LLC? What about a C Corp? What about a DBA?&quot; All of these different things, and it can be kind of confusing. How does it all work? What do you do? All of this stuff, and it gets people stuck. The truth is, is that you don&#039;t need a registered business to sign up clients and accept their money. Legally, and I&#039;m pretty sure this is the case all around the world, but don&#039;t hold me to that, because I haven&#039;t been all around the world, I only really know Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the United States and UK and Ireland, and quite a lot of different countries, but not everything.

Pretty much all of the countries I&#039;ve looked at, it&#039;s legal to sign up clients, make money and everything, and run like a business, just without registering one just using your own name. It&#039;s fully legal and everything. However, it&#039;s not recommended, because it&#039;s not what professional consultants or business people do. It also gets messy come tax season and everything, because you&#039;ve got all of your personal stuff tangled with your business stuff. You also don&#039;t have separate bank accounts, so it&#039;s hard to manage that stuff. It also doesn&#039;t look the best. The perceived image of not having a company, it doesn&#039;t really wash well with people, especially vendors, like if you&#039;re trying to sign up with Stripe to accept credit cards, they&#039;re not even going to accept you if you don&#039;t have a business.

A lot of different vendors are going to be like, and a lot of prospective clients are going to be like that too. No one will take you seriously, unless you have a business. I&#039;m kind of with them. If someone doesn&#039;t have a business, I&#039;m like, &quot;What is this person doing? Is this person a hobbyist? Is this a one off?&quot; It&#039;s something which you do. In this program I want to show you how to do things properly. We&#039;re not taking short cuts on anything here. If something needs to be done, we&#039;re going to be doing it. We&#039;re going to get it done, because I want everyone in this program to do things properly and to not take any shortcuts or cut any corners and really build a solid business that&#039;s on par ... We&#039;re actually further ahead than the rest of your marketplace. I want this group to be ninjas. That&#039;s why I&#039;ve gone out of my way to show you how to do things thoroughly the right way.

It is highly recommended that you set one up. Why? What are the benefits? What do you get from registering a business compared to just running it like a personal sort of thing? Here is why you should register a business. When dealing with clients, some will ask what your company is called. When you don&#039;t have one, it&#039;s not the best look. You&#039;re like, &quot;Oh, I don&#039;t have one.&quot; It&#039;s probably not the best look. It&#039;s probably going to ruin the chance you had of signing that person up. The only people who trade without businesses are students, who have a one off job, and employees who do an odd job here and there and there&#039;s no point in them registering a business, because it&#039;s just kind of one off different things.

Real business and real professionals always have registered businesses. That means that you should too, because you want to prove to people that you do things properly. You also want to prove to people that this isn&#039;t just some fly by night thing, and that you&#039;re here to stay, you&#039;re here for good. That&#039;s what this does. When you have a registered business you&#039;ll be able to provide your clients with a company name, when they ask, and all of your invoices and receipts and bank accounts and everything will all have your company name on them too. While this might seem small, it looks more credible and trustworthy when dealing with clients.

If someone asks you for an invoice and you have to put your own personal name on there, and if they&#039;re like, &quot;Well, do you have a business registration number?&quot; And you&#039;re like, &quot;No.&quot; It might freak some people out. It might break some deals. It certainly won&#039;t be perceived that well. You should really register your own business, because it looks much more professional and it&#039;s the right way to do things.

Registering a business gives you the ability to accept credit cards. This is huge. If it was just for this one thing alone, you would do it, because credit cards is everything in this business, especially the way I&#039;m training you how to set up and run this business. It&#039;s everything. I don&#039;t have a check book. I&#039;ve also never received a check, actually that&#039;s not true, one time I received a check. My business does a lot of money. Checks are a thing of the past, they&#039;re gone. Bank wise, they&#039;re too complicated.

Accepting credit cards is massive. No credit card company is going to give you the ability to accept credit cards unless you register a business. Just for that reason alone, you should do it. Then once you can do that, you can accept credit cards on the phone, or via online. This is a massive advantage. Registering a business gives you separate bank accounts and credit or debit cards so that your personal and business expenses are not mixed up, which makes things easier and cleaner to manage. This is important because right now it might not seem like a big deal, but as you keep going with your business, you&#039;re going to have different expenses. You might buy a microphone here, you might sign up for this landing page subscription here, you might buy this little thing and that little thing, it might seem like nothing now, but over time, you&#039;ll have a few purchases. That will sort of rack up.

Then you&#039;re going to have different clients. They&#039;re going to pay you and that money&#039;s going to be coming in. Then, what I&#039;ve noticed with so many entrepreneurs is the money starts coming in and everything, the expenses start going in, then a year goes by, and then they come to try and do all of their accounting and it&#039;s a mess. The entrepreneur has to spend three weeks in pretty much isolation or quarantine trying to figure out what on earth happened. I&#039;ve seen that happen to people too many times, including myself in my first year in business. I know what sort of pain it&#039;s like. I wish I had just been a bit more sensible and to set things up and made them clean from the beginning, because after a year, or even after six months, it&#039;s just a big job and it sucks. It&#039;s better to do it right from day one.

Register a business, then go to your local bank, and open up an account with them, under your business name. That is what I recommended doing. The advantages of registering a business are obvious. I&#039;ve walked you through them. It really is a no brainer. Now let&#039;s talk about how to get it done. I put together some simple instructions, that show you step-by-step how to register your own business. This is the cheat sheet number five. It&#039;s called Registering Your Business, plain and simple. I&#039;ll pull this up right now, on my computer, show you what it looks like. It&#039;s available for download beneath this video in the resources section. Registering You Business Cheat Sheet.

Little introduction at the top, then there&#039;s instructions. I&#039;ll skim these real quick, but if want to the deep dive, then when you go to do this process for yourself, obviously you can go into this stuff in more detail. Step one, when registering a business, the first thing you should do is speak with a lawyer so that you can explain your situation and what your business will be doing etc. This way the lawyer will be able to give you a custom tailored advice on the exact type of business you should register and how to go about registering it.

There&#039;s a lot of different types of businesses to start, especially in America. In place like New Zealand, it&#039;s so simple, you don&#039;t even really need a lawyer because there&#039;s only one type of business to start. You should register one, it&#039;s just a limited liability company in New Zealand, I think it&#039;s pretty much the same in Australia, it&#039;s probably the same in a lot of countries, it&#039;s very easy to do. Unless you&#039;re making a whole bunch of money, or you&#039;re dealing with a whole bunch of different share holders or investors or things, or you don&#039;t have a whole bunch of loans, then you don&#039;t really need a lawyer. It&#039;s totally up to you.

Obviously, the right thing to do, well I wouldn&#039;t really say, &quot;Right,&quot; but obviously the safest this to do would be to hire a lawyer and get their advice on what to do. That&#039;s why we&#039;ve put this in here. Depending on the city and state and country and everything, if you hire a lawyer, they will make sure that you get the best structure given your resources and location. To register your business and consult a lawyer with them, it might cost anywhere from $500 to $5000 plus. It totally depends on the caliber of the lawyer you use and the structure you go with and everything.

Now, we do recommend this as step one. However, I know that a lot of people just don&#039;t have this sort of money to spend. If all you have is like a $1000, and a lawyer is going to cost you like a $1000, then that&#039;s not a good use of your money, straight up. That&#039;s not a smart decision, because your risk at that level, isn&#039;t very high. There&#039;s not much point in doing that. You kind of got to weigh out the risk/reward scenario here and see what you should do.

If you&#039;re already running a very big business, then yes, you should use a lawyer, because there&#039;s a lot of risk involved, because there&#039;s a lot of money being made, a lot of clients, a lot of exposure. But, when you&#039;re brand new, honestly, your exposure is so small, that there&#039;s not a huge amount to gain from using one, but we are recommending it as the thing to do. But, if you can&#039;t afford one, and if it&#039;s not an option for you right now, that&#039;s totally fine. We have another option that&#039;s much cheaper, and this is option number two.

I know many of you in this program are just starting out and trying to do as efficiently and as cheaply as possible. Don&#039;t worry, I was exactly the same way when I got started too. I was pretty much running on a oily rag when I got started in business. People were telling me to use a lawyer to start my company, and I thought the cost just to open the company, which was like a hundred and fifty bucks was expensive. Then the lawyers wanted like three grand or something, so I was like, &quot;There&#039;s no way that&#039;s happening.&quot; I found another way to open it. It worked fine for me, and quite honestly, I&#039;d do it the same way if I was to start over again anyway.

If a lawyer isn&#039;t an option, then what you want to do is find out what company&#039;s office handles your country, state, city by searching online through Google. Once you&#039;ve found their website, see if there&#039;s any help documentation or tutorials available online. I found that a lot of people say, &quot;Oh, you&#039;ve got to speak to a lawyer about this.&quot; But then you can call up the actual company&#039;s office, and there&#039;s people there that help you, and they&#039;re actually really nice, and wanting to help you. Quite a lot of the time, they know exactly what they&#039;re talking about, because they work at the company&#039;s office.

A lot of the time, it&#039;s not as complicated or as scary or as anything as you think. The information&#039;s all available out there. You can just look it up and ask for help and people will help you. What you want to do is tell them your situation, or go through the online information, go through the work process and see what sort of business you think you should set up. When you do it yourself like this, without a lawyer and without any fancy stuff, it typically costs you between $100 and $300, and that depends on your country and your state and your city. It&#039;s typically pretty cheap.

I remember when I first opened a company in America, I didn&#039;t do any fancy stuff, I just went on the internet and just went to open an LLC, found some website, cost me like 150 bucks, put in my info and it opened me an LLC and I was in business. It cost me 150 bucks, I did it on the internet from New Zealand. I didn&#039;t use a lawyer or anything. To be honest, that&#039;s all you really need to do in the beginning. It is recommended to use a lawyer, but I know for a lot of people that&#039;s not an option. I have to provide something here to accommodate to those people, because otherwise, what I would be saying would be, &quot;You should use a lawyer, and if you don&#039;t have enough money to use a lawyer, then don&#039;t do anything.&quot; That&#039;s not good advice. This is my secondary piece of advice. I did it myself.

The thing is, is that you can always restructure your company later. What I recommend when people are starting out, don&#039;t spend all of your money on all of this fancy stuff like lawyers and everything, because later on, when you&#039;re actually going to have some sort of benefit to make from restructuring it, that&#039;s when you can spend the money to do it. But don&#039;t risk money right now for things that are far in the future, because when you&#039;re starting out your consulting business, it&#039;s all about short term survival, and you&#039;re not really playing the long game in the beginning.

As you start to make more money, and as your cash pile, and cash reserves start to accumulate, that&#039;s when you start to think more about the long game and you start to set aside some of that war chest for securing things and structuring them properly for long term benefits. When it comes to survival, you always want to focus on the short term when you&#039;re brand new, because what&#039;s the point of worrying about the long term when you get wiped out in the short term and not even make it to the long term? It&#039;s not a good use of money. I&#039;m sure you get my point here. If you want to dive deeper, this worksheet shows you everything you need to know to register your own business. That is step number five of six when assembling the war machine.

Now step six of six is accepting credit cards. This is a big one. That big should really be like a hundred times bigger. That big should fill up the whole screen, because that&#039;s how big this one is. It is huge, it&#039;s so important. I&#039;m not just exaggerating this, without this, then my company wouldn&#039;t make any money. We don&#039;t receive checks, we don&#039;t receive cash, we don&#039;t receive bank wires. Without this one thing alone, my company would be ruined. It is huge, it is so important.

I&#039;m always shocked when I hear that somebody doesn&#039;t have the ability to accept credit cards. I hear it all the time, there&#039;s people in the Facebook group, there&#039;s even people getting clients, and they&#039;re clients are sending them checks. Some people I see, their clients have given them cash. I&#039;m like, &quot;What is going on?&quot; I never even have cash on me, let alone would I pay for anything cash. It&#039;s very rare that someone&#039;s going to pay for something in cash, or with a check, or with a bank wire of any of that stuff. I ask them how they expect to get paid from their clients.

They tell me that clients send them checks in the mail and sometimes manual bank wires. I believe them, because I&#039;ve see the pictures and I&#039;ve seen the proof and everything. But that is just not the way to do it. This is 2017 people. You shouldn&#039;t be sending checks. You shouldn&#039;t be receiving checks, it&#039;s a waste of time. If you can receive money instantaneously, without shuffling any paper or moving a single finger, then you should be doing it. You shouldn&#039;t be using manual clunky processes like checks and bank wires.

Having the ability to accept credit cards online and via the phone is essential in today&#039;s business world. It is mandatory and here&#039;s why. Accepting credit cards gives you the ability to ask for payment right on the sales call when the prospect has agreed to sign up. It&#039;s a way to seal the deal, and collect payment right there and at that moment. All you have to say when you&#039;re like, &quot;Okay, is this something you want to?&quot; And they&#039;re like, &quot;Yes, let&#039;s do it.&quot; Then all you have to say is, &quot;Will that be Visa or MasterCard?&quot; then they will tell you, &quot;Okay, we can use Visa.&quot;

We say Visa or MasterCard, because it just sounds good, it&#039;s a good way to close and collect the payment, however, we can accept AMEX, Discover, all of that other stuff, it just doesn&#039;t sound as smooth. That&#039;s why we use it. If you do a sales call with somebody and they agree to sign up and then you ask them to send a check to your address via physical mail, the chances of them not sending that check are huge. This happens to everyone, I hear it all the time. Like, &quot;I signed this guy up, he was so excited and everything, but now I can&#039;t get a hold of him. It&#039;s kind of like he&#039;s disappeared.&quot; Or, &quot;This guy was so excited, we signed him up and everything, but he keeps telling me that the check&#039;s in the mail.&quot; That&#039;s like ... it reminds me of that excuse that Bart Simpson gave his teacher he was like, &quot;My dog ate it,&quot; about the homework.

When a prospective client tells you that the check&#039;s in the mail and it&#039;s been in the mail for a while, it&#039;s pretty much like the dog ate it excuse. It&#039;s just a lie. These are the sorts of things you have to put up with when you deal with these methods. It sucks, it&#039;s not the sort of thing you should be doing. You&#039;re a consultant and an expert, you should be serving your clients and signing up new clients. You shouldn&#039;t be being a teacher and chasing people around and asking where their check is. Then there&#039;s delays, lost in mail, so on, so forth, it&#039;s just not a nice thing to do.

Credit card transactions are instant and low friction, all you need to do is give somebody 16 digits and an expiry date and it&#039;s done. The money is instantly charged from their account and it will be in your account in two to three days without you doing anything, that&#039;s it, done. Credit card transactions give the buyer the ability to purchase products and services with credit, ie, money they don&#039;t have. This is a huge, huge, huge advantage. Most people use credit for things. They don&#039;t use their money, because most people don&#039;t have much money, but they do have available balances on credit cards.

People can&#039;t bank wire or cut checks with money they don&#039;t have. If you&#039;re only way of accepting payment is check or bank wire, then a whole bunch of people just got wiped out from your market, because they don&#039;t have an available balance in their checking account to actually do a check or a bank wire. However, with credit cards, it&#039;s a different story. It&#039;s money they don&#039;t have, it&#039;s credit, it&#039;s debt. When you accept credit cards, it allows people to pay for your services and everything with money they don&#039;t have. Credit cards are like toy money. I&#039;m not saying this for ... It&#039;s not really a good way to live. You shouldn&#039;t be doing this when you&#039;re running your business, but the truth is, is that most people in the world, operate this way. We should be taking advantage of it instead of just accepting checks and bank wires.

Yes, you do have to pay a credit card processing fee of 2-3%. I can probably hear some people watching this video right now, and they&#039;re like, &quot;I don&#039;t want to accept credit cards, because there&#039;s a fee.&quot; Guys, it&#039;s 2-3%, and when you get up to high volume, like the volume I&#039;m at, they give me 1.5%. Honestly that is nothing compared to the value you get from accepting credit cards. First of all, you get to widen your market up and you get to accept money from people who don&#039;t have money, because they&#039;re able to use credit, that in itself massive. Then you&#039;re able to increase the closing ratio on your calls, boom. Then you&#039;re able to collect the money faster, boom, another benefit. Then you&#039;re able to save a huge amount of time, because you don&#039;t have to run around looking for checks and delivering checks and all that sort of stuff, boom, another advantage.

I don&#039;t understand why anyone could actually say that, it just makes no sense to me. The value you get from accepting credit cards far exceeds the small cost. It&#039;s one of those asymmetric relationships where the upside is huge, the cost is absolutely minuscule. It&#039;s a no brainer for anyone that has a brain. You want to accept credit cards, forget about the fee, it&#039;s nothing compared to the value. Anybody who complains about this, or doesn&#039;t do it, or if you hear anyone give you advice, like, &quot;Oh, you shouldn&#039;t be doing that. You should just get bank wires,&quot; whatever, don&#039;t listen to them. If someone&#039;s trying to save two, three percent by saying goodby to like 30%, then that&#039;s stupid.

If someone&#039;s trying to do this in an attempt to save money, then they are an absolute moron. I don&#039;t often go to the extent of saying something like that, however, in this case, it is warranted, because I just can&#039;t see any possible case for how someone could make a decision like that, unless they were an actual moron. You can see the benefits of accepting credit cards, they are obvious, it&#039;s a no brainer.

I put together some simple instructions, showing you step-by-step how to start accepting credit cards yourself. Let&#039;s take a look. This is the final cheat sheet, or instructions sheet available for download beneath this video. It&#039;s called, Number six, Accepting Credit Cards. Let&#039;s take a look. It&#039;s in the resources section. You can download it yourself right now. Looks like this, let&#039;s have a quick walk through. Accepting Credit Cards cheat sheet, at the top there&#039;s a little intro, then there&#039;s instructions, where we walk you through each step.

You&#039;ll need to register the business in order to accept this, that&#039;s why I told you to get one. Then you&#039;ll also need a business bank account, that&#039;s why I told you to get one, so you follow these instructions. Then you set up your Stripe account by just clicking this link here. Then you follow the instructions to activate your Stripe account. I can just pull this up right here. I&#039;ll just have to open this in a different window, because I&#039;m logged into my Stripe account right now.

The website looks like this. This is hands down the best payment processor in the world right now, you want to be using it. You would just go to Create an Account, and you just follow the instructions, create your account, very simple. It&#039;s available in lots of different countries all around the world. If it&#039;s not available in your country, then that&#039;s rare. I would look for Stripe alternatives on Google and you&#039;ll be able to find one. However, in pretty much all the countries that I&#039;ve looked at, you can get Stripe and it is awesome.

You set up your account there. Then follow the instructions to activate your Stripe account. This will require you to enter in your company name info, company number, tax ID, etc, that&#039;s why we obviously want a company. Then once you submit all that info it&#039;ll take them around 24-48 hours to approve it. Once they approve it, they&#039;ll shoot you an email. Then you want to set up a Payfunnels account. Payfunnels was actually set up by a member of our consulting accelerator program, who Dave Rogenmoser, who is one of our seven figure case studies.

He set it up for himself when he was starting his consulting business. He ended up having a lot of other people who wanted to use it too, and now they&#039;ve put together a special discount for us. If you go to payfunnels.com/samovens, or if you click that link, you get $20 a month off and it&#039;s a very cheap application. What you&#039;re able to do, is have a free trial of it, see how it works for you. It&#039;s super simple, you can set it up really quick, and it integrates with Stripe and you don&#039;t need any tech or anything. You can invoice your customers. It sends them receipts, everything you could possible want, just all with a couple clicks.

A lot of people in our program use it, and it&#039;s a great platform. You can create an account there. Then you follow the instructions to set up your Payfunnels account, then you link your Stripe account to your Payfunnels account by following the instructions provided by Payfunnels. Then once that&#039;s all set up, then you do a live test. You set up a small 5-$10 transaction in Payfunnels, and you charge your own credit card. You put your own details in, and then what you&#039;re trying to do is, first of all look if it charged your credit card. Then you want to see that it worked in Payfunnels. Then you want to see that it worked in Stripe, because all of these things are connected. You want to see that Payfunnels is working correctly with Stripe. You want to see that Stripe is correctly charging your card. Then you&#039;ll have to wait two or three days for the money to clear into your bank account. Then you want to check that Stripe is correctly integrated with your bank account.

You want to do an end to end test to make sure that the money went out of your card, through all of these systems, and then it went into your business bank account at the end. You want to do an end to end test. That means the whole system is online and integrated correctly. If it does that, awesome, you&#039;re ready to go and you now have the ability to accept credit cards online and via the phone, which is a absolute weapon.

I&#039;ve also given you down here, a workflow for accepting credit card payments. Once you&#039;ve got that set up, here&#039;s our workflow and our process for billing people at the end of a strategy session. At the end of the sales call, if someone wants to sign up you just ask them, &quot;Well, Visa or MasterCard?&quot; They&#039;ll go, &quot;Okay, yeah, I&#039;ll just get my Visa out.&quot; They&#039;ll get their Visa out, and then you ask them for the card number. You shut up, they give you their card number, it should be 16 digits, and you want to separate those when you write them down into four sets of four, because it just is easier to remember like that. It&#039;s also easier to get the numbers accurate.

Then you want to write down the expiry date, the three digit security code, ask them for the name on their card, sometimes that differentiates from their actual name. You want to make sure you get that right. Then I like to write it all down on a piece of paper, as I&#039;m doing the strategy session. Then I want to make sure I&#039;ve got it correctly. Then I&#039;ll say, &quot;Thank you,&quot; or, &quot;I&#039;m going to go ahead and process your transaction right now. You should get a receipt and everything in the email in the next five, ten minutes, and I look forward to working with you.&quot; Then we end the call.

Then when I&#039;ve ended the call, I will go into Payfunnels, and I will process the transaction. I will set it all up, and then I will enter in the credit info from my piece of paper on my desk. Then when it&#039;s run successfully, when it goes through, I then tear up and get rid of the piece of paper on my desk. That&#039;s what I like to do, it&#039;s secure and everything that way, and it&#039;s better than writing it in a Google Doc or something on your computer, that&#039;s not a good idea. You don&#039;t want to put people&#039;s credit card info in places like that.

If you&#039;re going to write it down somewhere, put it on a piece of paper, then charge it properly, then get rid of that piece of paper right away. That&#039;s really a good workflow, and a good process for doing it compared to some of the other work flows I&#039;ve seen people use. When you have your own Stripe account, and when you&#039;ve got your own ability to accept credit cards, you have to be responsible. Don&#039;t mess around with it, make sure you keep it secure and everything, because when you start your own business, you have a few responsibilities. If you mess up the responsibility, then they will take it away from you, and you won&#039;t have the ability to accept credit cards anymore. Make sure you treat it with respect and you&#039;re careful and everything about it, and you&#039;ll continue to have the privilege.

Then it will take one to three business days for that money to clear from Stripe into your business bank account. Sometimes the first transaction you run with them, will take seven days. That&#039;s totally fine. Don&#039;t worry about the time, it&#039;s the just the first transaction takes a bit of time, because they&#039;ve got to verify some stuff, but after that, Stripe&#039;s pretty good. The money gets charged immediately from the client&#039;s card the moment you enter it in Payfunnels. Then it just takes one to three days to trickle into your account.

Like all of these things, this is just kind of a 30,000 foot view, brief skim over it. If you want to deep dive into this, and when you go to set up all of the stuff yourself, you can go into this workflow and this process and complete it all yourself. That is six of six in assembling the war machine, accepting credit cards, and that&#039;s a big one. Once you&#039;ve completed all six of these steps, congratulations. The war machine is assembled, and ready for battle.

You are now prepared and trained to strategically and mentally, you know, we&#039;ve worked at high level strategy, we&#039;ve really turned you into a business ninja. The amount of stuff that I&#039;ve taught you and the real depth of knowledge and everything that you have right now, the strategic thinking, and everything, it&#039;s really going to separate you and put you at a whole nother level inside the market that you&#039;re going into. You&#039;re also prepared mentally. We trained you in week two with all that mindset, new paradigm, and world view stuff. That is next level training when it comes to sharpening up your mindset.

You also have the tactics and you have the technology. We gave you the sales script. That thing is a weapon in itself. We trained you up on how to use it. We got your practicing it. Then we showed you all of the different tactics to get clients; paid methods, organic methods. We showed you all of the different things you can deploy. We gave you all of the information in detail. Anyone can really deploy any of these methods, and there is a large variety of methods. You also have the technology. That&#039;s what we covered in this video today, when we were assembling the war machine.

You&#039;ve got your Google Calendar. You&#039;ve got you Gmail. You&#039;ve got your Google Drive, you&#039;ve got it linked up to your schedule one so people can schedule appointments with you. You&#039;ve got your fragmentation funnel. You&#039;ve got your website set up. You&#039;ve got your own domain name. You&#039;ve got all of these different things set up, and you&#039;re further ahead than a lot of businesses who even think that they&#039;re far ahead. You&#039;re dancing around some people that actually think they&#039;re tech savvy. It might not feel like it for some of you guys, you might think this is nothing, but if you do six out of six methods in this training video today, you are pretty advanced and evolved compared to the average participant in any marketplace.

It&#039;s going to pay dividends and it&#039;s going to certainly help as you go out into the market and try to make some money, and try to get some clients. You really have everything you need to go to battle now. The war machine is assembled and ready for battle. There&#039;s only one thing remaining. Here are the six things, which I mentioned earlier in the video today that you need in order to prepare yourself and your business for the battlefield.

The first one is a business name and domain name, and we did that in today&#039;s video. You also need a business website, we did that. You need a business email and calendar, we did that. You need a fragmentation funnel to take interested prospects from strangers to scheduled appointments, we did that. You also need a registered business, you need some business bank accounts and the ability to accept credit cards online or via the phone, and we did that. We got all of these things ticked off. That puts us pretty far ahead, further ahead than most participants in any market out there.

There&#039;s really only one thing left, and that is number six, an immediate action plan for the next 30 days that shows you exactly what to do each day. We&#039;ve assembled the war machine, you&#039;ve got everything you need, but like I said, you could have the best army with the best technology and weaponry and everything, but if you didn&#039;t give them an action plan, and if they didn&#039;t know what they were doing immediately, in these next 30 days, they would be useless.

The last thing left is this 30 day action plan. That is what we&#039;re going to create in the next module, right after this one in this week&#039;s training. It&#039;s called Planning Your 30 D Attack. 30 D Attack stands for 30 Day Attack. That&#039;s module six, week four. That&#039;s the next video that you&#039;ll be doing after this one. That&#039;s where we we&#039;ll be plotting out your next 30 days strategically and then once they&#039;re plotted out, just executing on that action plan. Waking up each day, looking at the action plan, executing. That&#039;s the way, and that&#039;s the path to success.

Now, let&#039;s quickly talk about action items, because there&#039;s a lot of them in this training module. There&#039;s a lot of them in this week as a whole. Here&#039;s your action items this week. You are to set up all six of these things. The minimum that you&#039;re allowed to set up is all of these things except for the fragmentation funnel. That&#039;s the only thing that is really negotiable on this list, because all the other things you need.

You need to set up your business name and domain, business website, email and calendar, I recommend you do the fragmentation funnel, you need to register your business, get your bank accounts, get Stripe, get the ability to accept credit cards, and then you need the immediate action plan for the next 30 days, and that&#039;s what you&#039;re going to get from the next training video, module number six in week four. These are your action items this week. Everyone&#039;s got some work to do. Everyone&#039;s got to buckle down, get this stuff done, get it checked off. You&#039;ve got all of the instructions, you&#039;ve got all of the support you need, there&#039;s no reason why you can&#039;t get it done. That is it for this training module. Everyone&#039;s got quite a lot of work to do, so I want everyone to get to it, and let&#039;s get to work. Thanks for watching this video, and I&#039;ll see you in the next module, module number six right now. Thanks.
