                        Hi everyone, Sam Ovens here and welcome to this training module called Planning Your 30-Day Attack.

Now in this video I&#039;m going to show you how to take all of the different things that we&#039;ve learned throughout this training program to this point. Really, bring it all together and put it into an actionable plan for the next 30 days or your first 30 days of action.

I understand it takes some time to go through this program to consume all of the information, get your head around it, learn it, complete the action items, and also establish your business. That takes some time, but when I talk about a 30-day attack I mean your first 30 days of going to your market. Your first 30 days of sending out direct outreach messages. Your first 30 days of sales calls and basically, your first 30 days of action.

We&#039;re going to show you in this video how to plot those out so that you know exactly what&#039;s in front of you each day. All you have to do is wake up each day and execute on it and if you do that then you should be able to accomplish your dreams and your goals and your targets and everything like that. It&#039;s a very powerful video. We&#039;ve got a few very powerful resources to share with you as well in this one, so make sure you pay close attention and watch this one till the end.

Here&#039;s what we&#039;re going to cover in today&#039;s training. We&#039;re going to start off with why we need to plan our attack for the next 30 days or for your first 30 days. Setting clearly defined targets. Why that&#039;s important? How you should set your targets. If you&#039;ve got absolutely no idea what you should be aiming for then I&#039;m going to bring some clarity to that for you and tell you what. We&#039;re going to get that written down. Everyone&#039;s going to have theirs defined.

Then we&#039;re going to reverse engineer those targets with mathematical precision all the way back and find out how exactly we&#039;re going to make that happen. We&#039;re going to look at every single different piece that goes into achieving the target that you want to achieve and then we&#039;re going to break it all down mathematically and then we&#039;re going plot it out day by day exactly what you need to do each day. We&#039;re not going to fool ourselves. I know a lot of people fool themselves. They like to see it lofty dreams and lofty goals and everything. They feel great that they&#039;ve got these awesome goals set but they never seem to make them happen.

It&#039;s great setting goals but you need to reverse engineer it down and you need to get really real with the detail of what actually goes into making those goals happen because achieving goals just doesn&#039;t happen. You can think about it all you want. You can lie around and meditate all you want, but it&#039;s not going to happen unless you reverse engineer it and execute on those daily action items. Then what we&#039;re going to do once we understand what goes into achieving your goals, we&#039;re going to plot your strategy and daily actions on something that I call a war map. War maps are one of my secret weapons. I&#039;ve used them since the very beginning to coordinate my strategies and really execute on everything day to day.

There&#039;s a lot going around and you hear them all the time when you&#039;re starting a business. You&#039;ve got to balance so many different things. Sometimes you lose sight of you&#039;re actually supposed to be doing. You wake up in the morning, you go over to your laptop or your computer and you start doing stuff and before you know it, the whole day is gone and you haven&#039;t really achieved anything. Well, that&#039;s what happens when you don&#039;t have a war map and you don&#039;t build a really solid practice around a war map.

I&#039;m going to show you exactly how I do it and I&#039;m going to share with you the exact war map I use so that you can use it for yourself. This is going to change the game for a lot of people. Then we&#039;re going to talk about organic list building. Let&#039;s say we figure out that you have to send 10 direct outreach messages to people every single day to achieve your goals. How do you find those 10 people? How do you go about generating a list of those 10 people so that you can send a direct outreach message or a lumpy mail package to them? I&#039;m going to show exactly step by step how to build a list organically. This is if you&#039;re not using paid Facebook ads so that you can actually make things happen.

Then I&#039;m going show you how to make revenue-generating activities and ingrained daily habit instead of a dreaded task. A lot of people are so used to procrastinating and they&#039;re so used to doing busy work that when it comes to actually doing something meaningful and deep, they can&#039;t do it because their brain&#039;s hardwired to do the exact opposite. I know this is the case for so many entrepreneurs. I see it in people every single day. I want to share with you a cool hack that I learned to make revenue-generating activities, the things that are important, an ingrained habit. How to really burn a thick cable into your brain when it comes to doing revenue-generating activities so you don&#039;t even have to think about. You wake up, you open your eyes and you&#039;re doing it. That&#039;s what we&#039;re going to help you achieve.

Then finally, we&#039;re going to discuss violent daily execution. Once we have figured out what you want, once we&#039;ve set your targets and we&#039;ve reverse engineered it back and then we&#039;ve plotted it onto a war map and we&#039;ve started building a habit so that you can execute on that, on those daily actions items, we&#039;re going to talk about what it takes each and every day to really execute on your daily action items and achieve success. Achieve the targets that you want to achieve.

This is an awesome video because it&#039;s all around taking all the strategy and tactics that we have discussed in this program up until this point. We&#039;re really pulling it all together and plotting it onto a map and we&#039;re going to start taking action. This is really where the fun starts happening. This is where the rubber meets the road and people start getting results and making money. Because everything up until this point we&#039;ve been educating you, training you, preparing you, and we&#039;ve covered a lot of theory, we&#039;ve covered a lot of conceptual stuff. We&#039;ve done a lot of work together, but right now is where we really flip over and we start applying that stuff to the market and we start getting you out there talking to your market, making sales, getting clients and making money. I&#039;m really looking forward to everyone starting this process and let&#039;s get right to it.

Why do we need to plan our attack for the next 30 days? Why specifically 30 days? Well, there&#039;s something very interesting about the people who succeed in this program. The people who make it to five figures, six figures, seven figures and more, we&#039;ve got someone who&#039;s almost at eight figures now which is almost unheard off, like what training program creates students that make eight figures. That&#039;s more than most coaches make. It&#039;s crazy the results this program has got.

They do things a little bit differently. For starts, they commit to consulting. They don&#039;t have one foot in ecommerce and one foot in this other thing and one foot in blogging. They commit to consulting. They&#039;re like, consulting is what I want to do and I&#039;m going to make it happen and they commit. Then they commit to a niche. They&#039;re not niche jumpers bouncing around 10 different niches all frenzied out, they commit. They&#039;re like I&#039;m going to do accounting or I&#039;m going to focus on personal trainers, or I&#039;m going to focus on yoga instructors. They commit not only to consulting but to a niche. Then they roll their sleeves up and do the work. They don&#039;t just sit around and talk about it. They get into it and they do it.

There&#039;s something else that I&#039;ve observed. It&#039;s not only these things. They all gave the first 30 days of action everything they had. When I say the first 30 days of action, obviously, it took them sometime to go through the program and learn things but when they started taking action, once they started approaching their market, that&#039;s when those first 30 days of actions started and they gave it everything they had, they went all out.

If the average person dips their toe in, these people were 5,000 feet under chained to an anchor. Here&#039;s what I&#039;ve observed from five years of practicing and teaching consulting to more than 10,000 different people. Here&#039;s my observation. First of all, people who quit before 30 days almost never show results in anything, even outside of this program. I&#039;ve found it really fastening, we pay close attention, we keep a list of the people who give up and just forget about things before the 30-day mark. It&#039;s interesting to track them and see what they&#039;re doing because I&#039;m really interested in that. What&#039;s fascinating is the people who quit before 30 days, they almost never achieve anything. This is over a time horizon of five years and with a lot of people. That&#039;s really quiet bad like people who give up too early, it&#039;s not just this one thing, it&#039;s typically everything in their life. That&#039;s one huge observation that&#039;s fascinating so you definitely don&#039;t want to do that.

Then people who stick but don&#039;t take consistent action for the first 30 days almost never show results at any stage. It&#039;s not just about sticking. Obviously sticking is a tiny bit better than quitting but if the people who stick around and keep just reading things and they never actually put it into practice. The people who become like conceptual geniuses but never actually take action they almost never show results to any stage either. It&#039;s still not very good for these people.

People who take consistent action for the first 30 days typically continue to take consistent action and they always end up getting clients and making money. However, their results differ depending on the level of commitment. What&#039;s fascinating is the people who take action for consistently for the first 30 days once they go to the market, that really creates their pattern that foreshadows what they&#039;re going to do for the rest of their time. I pretty much observed that whatever people do in their first 30 days is what they&#039;ll do in the next 30 days and the next and it keeps going for years.

People who set a good precedent on those first 30 days, they pretty much always keep going and eventually, they always get a client or more. Some people make it to five figures, six figures, seven figures and stuff. The results vary but what the real driving force behind the differentiation and the result is the level of commitment that they put into it. It&#039;s how seriously they take it. It&#039;s how much of themselves they put into it. The people who arm themselves to the teeth and go all out in the first 30 days typically make 1,000 times more than the average students and they end up becoming five figures, six figures, seven figures, and soon to be eight-figure students. Like I&#039;ve said we&#039;ve almost got someone at eight figures.

When I say a thousand times more, I&#039;m not even joking. We have figured out to how much the average person makes in this training program. The people who absolutely crash it, they make more than a thousand times more than the average person. That is quite amazing with 1,000 times. This isn&#039;t some, 2x, 5x or even 10x advantage. I hear people throwing these numbers around like 2x, 5x, even 10x. We&#039;re talking an actual 1000x advantage. This isn&#039;t just some figure of speech. This is measured in actual.

Why does this happen? The initial conditions set precedent for future conditions and they pay dividends exponentially or in more simple terms, the action and results you take in the first 30 days will be a clear indication of the action and results you take in the following 30 days and the 30 days following that, and it just keeps continuing. Whatever you do in the first 30 days it&#039;s going to create a habit and a pattern for the rest of your time in consulting. What I&#039;ve observed is people who really give it everything in those first 30 days, they often see results in the first 30 days. When they see results they go even harder the next month and that means they do even better the next month and then go even harder the next month. It starts really just ratcheting up like that and it starts really just going through a feedback loop and things start curving exponentially.

Really, if we&#039;re to look at the root cause of all of the people in this program who have made seven figures and up like we&#039;ve got 21 people now who&#039;ve made more than a million dollars with this program. If we&#039;re to observe what really was it that made them go, it was what they did it in their first 30 days. All of this success really just was built on that.

Here&#039;s what that means for you. If you want to be 1000 times more successful than the average student in this program, your first 30 days of action will be your best bet. If you want to be like extremely successful. If you want to be one of the seven-figure or eight-figure students in this program, 30 days, your first 30 days of action is where you make that happen. That&#039;s your best leverage point for achieving it. If you&#039;re ready to arm yourself to the teeth and go all out, awesome. This video is going to show you exactly how to do it.

The first thing we need to do is set clearly defined the targets. Now, we need to have a target. We need to know what we&#039;re aiming for. If you don&#039;t have target it&#039;s like going to the airport without knowing where you want to go. You might just end up in Africa and be like I didn&#039;t want to go to Africa. Well, that&#039;s what happens when you don&#039;t have a clearly defined target.

Without a clearly defined target, even the most effective person achieves nothing. You could have the best army in the world with $7 trillion worth of training and machinery and everything, but if they don&#039;t have a target and if they don&#039;t know where the target is, then they&#039;re not going to achieve anything. Having a target is so important, it really is everything. The people who don&#039;t set targets, their progress in life looks like this.

Here is pinup available for download in the resources section beneath this video and it&#039;s a good example of what happens to people who plan and people who don&#039;t plan. It says by failing to plan you are planning to fail. Without a plan of action and clearly defined targets of what you want to achieve, you will achieve nothing, even if you work 12 hours a day.

Some of the busiest, most energetic and productive people I&#039;ve ever meet seem to achieve things daily but never achieve anything outside of that. They master the art of busyness, not business. Over time it doesn&#039;t matter how productive you are with your daily activities, what matters is the targets you set for yourself over the longer horizons like the 30 day to 12 month horizons and then how you chip at them each day. It&#039;s not about just being busy day to day. It&#039;s about chipping at the longer term things.

Here&#039;s this cool diagram here on the right hand side of the screen. The people who are really busy and they&#039;re often multitasking with like six different cellphones and seven social media accounts and four Gmail accounts, they look like they&#039;re building like a NASA spaceship. These people are so productive and you bet that they&#039;ve read every single book on hacking productivity and they&#039;ve got six different to-do lists.

These people they look like they&#039;re achieving a lot and they&#039;re doing a lot, they&#039;re exerting a lot of energy and they&#039;re actually taking a lot of action. However, over a period of time their progress just looks like this big mess. It&#039;s just this big squiggle of all these drawings. They&#039;re not really going anywhere. They&#039;re just building mess on top of mess.

Then, there&#039;s the person with a plan. The average person is the person who is just busy day to day and then the person with the plan. The person with the plan doesn&#039;t look so frantic and busy day to day. However, over a longer period of time that person separates from that pack and starts to show a trajectory that looks like this. That&#039;s what you&#039;ll start to notice. It&#039;s not really just about looking busy and heading lots of tasks out of the pack. If you&#039;re really good at doing tasks, I mean congratulations, you&#039;re a good personal assistant. It&#039;s not about doing tasks, it&#039;s about setting big goals and chipping at them.

Now here&#039;s the importance of planning. Quite often we know what to do and how to do it but without a clear plan of immediate action, it won&#039;t get done. Those without a plan will become a part of somebody else&#039;s plan. If you go about life each day without a plan, well someone who does have a plan is going to recruit you and make you a part of their plan. That&#039;s what happens when you don&#039;t have one. We need to hit our sales targets like we&#039;re here we ultimately to get clients and make money. We need to hit those sales targets. That&#039;s how we do that. That&#039;s how we get clients to make money but that&#039;s near impossible without a clear plan of action and execution.

If you don&#039;t have a plan, you can safely assume your plan is to fail by doing nothing at all. Quiet often, I&#039;m like I ask people like what are you aiming for, what are you trying to achieve, what do you want, what are you trying to get with this and what&#039;s the plan and then they say they don&#039;t really have one and I don&#039;t say anything back but I pretty much know that the plan which they&#039;re fooling them self by thinking they don&#039;t have one, they really do have one. The plan is to fail. It&#039;s really what it is.

When it comes to hitting sales targets and achieving goals, I plan as if I&#039;m going to war and treat my actions and behavior as life or death situations. I am deadly serious about plans and targets and the daily action items and things like that. If you want to be successful and if you want to really achieve your goals and dreams you should adapt the same level of commitment.

Now, you understand the importance of setting targets and planning, let&#039;s get it done. Let&#039;s set your targets for the next 30 days. In week two&#039;s mindset training, you would have done big picture thinking and thought well out into the future about what you want in your life. Then you probably thought 10 years out, five years out, and one year out. You should have at least thought one year out. At the very lease you need to think 12 months out. That is crucially important before you do anything else. You need to think what I want in one year from now.

Big picture planning is insanely powerful and most people don&#039;t do it at all. However, you should only do it once every two to three months when you pause from daily actions and reflect on your progress. Any more than that and you&#039;re procrastinating and fooling yourself by thinking that planning is action. Sometimes I notice people that get obsessed with planning to the point where they think that planning is actually taking action. Every day they&#039;re changing their plan and changing this and adding a new list and a new plan. It quickly becomes like procrastination.

What I&#039;ve noticed is that you should take some time to set your plan and that might take a day or a couple of days. Once you&#039;ve set your plan you just need to act on it and you forget about adjusting the plan for a while. I&#039;ve noticed it&#039;s in between two and three months and then after every 60 to 90 days I like to come back to my plan and reflect on what happened and then I like to make small iterations and improvements to it and that&#039;s what you should do as well. If you revisit your plan and change it around any more often than that then it&#039;s procrastination.

Once you have set your big picture goals and targets, it&#039;s time to break it down to the next 30 days and focus every ounce of effort you have on that. The only thing on your mind from this day forward should be the next 30 days and what you need to do each day.

How many clients do you want to get in the next 30 days and at what price point? In the mindset training you should have done some planning for the future and set some goals and things like that. How many clients do you want to get in the next 30 days? Pause this video right now, write it down. Just write it down on a piece of paper or notebook next to you.

You need to first all come up with this. You might think okay, &quot;Well, I want to get three clients or four clients,&quot; whatever it is, write it down and at what price point. How much are you going to charge for your services? Write it down. You might say $2,000 a month or it might $4,000 one-off package. Whatever your pricing is you should have designed that back in week one, so write it down.

If you&#039;re brand new to this and want to know a good number of clients to aim for, make it two clients at $2,000 each. That&#039;s a good target if you&#039;re brand new to this and you don&#039;t know what to aim for. Don&#039;t aim for anything less than that.

Make sure you define this number right now before continuing the video. Write it down right now. Pause it if you have to, get it done and then continue.

Now, that we&#039;ve set your targets. Now, that we know how many clients you want in the next 30 days and how much money you&#039;re going to get in the next 30 days if you get those two clients. Now it&#039;s time to revere engineer your success with mathematical precision. Most people don&#039;t understand that you can just set goals and then actually reverse engineer it. Most people think you set goals and then you just smile and sit on the coach or you set goals and then you just go back to sending emails and just reading blogs and things.

Those are the people who set goals and don&#039;t get them. In this community and in this program, we are the people who set goals and then get them and even exceed them all the time. Now that you know how many clients you want to get in the next 30 days we can calculate what sort of effort and action it&#039;s going to take to achieve it. To do this I have provided a reverse engineering success spreadsheet. This spreadsheet allows you to reverse engineer your goals and targets with mathematical precision down to the hours, dollars, and days. It&#039;s available for download beneath this video in the resources section. You can open it using Microsoft Word or no, sorry, not Microsoft Word. Microsoft Excel or Google Docs. I recommend Google Docs for all of the stuff. It&#039;s way better.

This is what the reverse engineering success spreadsheet looks like. Now, the first thing you&#039;ll notice is that there are two tabs down the bottom here. One is called reverse engineering and in brackets organics. The other reverse engineering and in brackets paid. Now there are two different spreadsheets with two different sets of formulas here. Like you all know after going through week four&#039;s training, when it comes to client attraction we have two different types of methods we use. One is organic which is free or near free and the other is paid, which is paid Facebook ads, driving that traffic into our fragmentation funnel.

Now, depending on what method you&#039;re using the formulas change. I have modeled out both these formulas so that you can reverse engineer your goals and your daily action items whatever method you are using. Like I&#039;ve say throughout this training program multiple times already, when starting out I recommend using organic methods first. The reason why we want to do that is because we need to establish a strong proof of concept and a proof of concept is basically proof and evidence that your hypothesis, which you set back in week one, is actually proven to be true in the marketplace. How you prove it to be true is you get at least three to five paying customers and your paying customers should be happy with your service that you&#039;re offering and it should be working in getting people results. That is how you know you&#039;ve got proof of concept.

When you&#039;re trying to establish a proof of concept you have to do quite a bit of testing. You&#039;re trying out this, you&#039;re trying out that, you&#039;re iterating, you&#039;re really doing a lot of testing of your hypothesis. When you&#039;re doing that, paid attraction methods are not the best way to go. It can be very expensive and complicated. I recommend starting with organic methods first, getting that proof of concept and then transitioning it to paid methods so we can really ratchet everything up and start scaling.

The first thing you want to do, I&#039;m going to assume that you&#039;re using organic methods. On the spreadsheet, the first thing you want to do is enter in today&#039;s date. Very important and we do that so we know when we return back to this spreadsheet later we know when we set these targets.

Once you&#039;ve done that, the next thing we do is we enter the target number of clients for the next 30 days. I got you to come up with that just about five minutes ago when watching this video. You should know what your target number of clients for the next 30 days is. You would plug that number in here. Now, it says two because like I said in the training if you don&#039;t know what you should set your target as, you should set it as two. You shouldn&#039;t set it any less than that. You could change this to whatever you want. You could put in five. You could put in 10. You could put in whatever you wanted and everything would change around in the spreadsheet. You can notice everything changes around when I plug in different numbers and that&#039;s because all these formulas are all linked together and it all changes when you adjust this number.

Let&#039;s say I want to get two clients in the first 30 days. The system calculates how many sales calls we need to achieve two sales. I&#039;ve plugged in here 10% conversion rate. Now, that&#039;s low, but it&#039;s always better to underestimate. It&#039;s always better to really understate all of our numbers when we&#039;re setting goals. The last thing we want to do is be overly optimistic with our actions. We want to be overly optimistic with our goals but then we really want to understate.

Sorry, what&#039;s the right way to put it? We want to think really big when it comes to our goals but when it comes to our actions, we want to take more action than actually necessary. Because if anything can happen, I would rather overshoot my goals than undershoot them so I typically set goals and then I plan more action than is even needed. That&#039;s what you should do too. I see too many people setting lofty goals and doing nothing about it.

I&#039;ve assumed that you&#039;re going to have a 10% conversion rate. Now, chances are, you&#039;re probably be higher than that. It&#039;s good to leave it as this. However, if you already are closing it like 20% of something, then you can obviously change this around and fit all of the numbers. If you&#039;ve got a 10% sales conversion rate and you want to get two sales, you&#039;ll need to do 20 sales calls. If you want to generate 20 sales calls, then you need to get 67 engagements. I&#039;ve created this metric called an engagement when you&#039;re doing organic methods. Typically, when you&#039;re doing organic direct outreach or lumpy mail or something like that, you&#039;re sending out messages, you might send an email or LinkedIn message or Facebook message.

Then what typically happens is someone replies or someone engages with you. If you just get a simple reply or a simply phone call or any sort of little thing like that, that is what we call an engagement. What I&#039;ve typically noticed is engagements convert to scheduled calls at around a rate of 30%. If you sent out 100 emails and then let&#039;s say 20 people replied back, we would consider that an engagement rate of 20% and you would have 20 engagements. Then what you&#039;d find is only 30% of those 20 would actually take you up on a sales call and schedule one with you. That&#039;s a good number to work with. If we want to get 20 sales calls, we need 67 engagements.

Now if we want to get 67 engagements, that means we need to send 333 direct outreach messages. This could be 330 different people we need to contact in order to engage with 67 of them. What I&#039;ve done here is I have calculated that on average to get an engagement from someone, it converts at about 20%. Like I said, if we sent out 100 emails to people, only about 20 of them would actually reply even if their reply was just anything. That doesn&#039;t mean that we&#039;ve really got a sales call with them. That just means they&#039;re somewhat interested and a small conversation starts. Then that converts into a sales call. There&#039;re multiple different stages here.

We need to send 333 messages to engage with 67 people and then get 20 calls scheduled in our calendar and then get two clients. That&#039;s how it really filters down. That&#039;s how natural selection is happening here. We talked about natural selection earlier in week four. This is the process filtering down like that. That&#039;s how we go from a large sample down to a small sample and find who we&#039;re looking for. Now what I&#039;d like to do with all of my models, this is a solid business practice that you should do. I learned this from Warren Buffett and he&#039;s probably a good dude to listen to when it comes to this sort of stuff because he&#039;s got quite a lot of money and he has to rely a lot on his projections and forecasts.

What Warren Buffett says is that he doesn&#039;t think he&#039;s infallible and he always thinks that humans make errors. What he likes to do is he considers his margin of error around 20%. Because he does that, I adapted that for myself too. Whenever I&#039;m modeling anything, I put a margin of safety for 20%. This means that I could be wrong by 20% on any of these numbers. I&#039;m going to assume that I&#039;m being 20% optimistic with everything. What we do is we add a 20% margin of safety. We assume that we&#039;re actually going to have to contact 400 people instead of 333. Now this is powerful because we&#039;ve already assumed that we&#039;re going to have a 10% closing rate which is low, then the 30% engagement rate and a 20% conversation to engagement rate.

Now, these numbers are all low which is good so it already being prudent. Then we are also adding a margin of safety. If anything these numbers, we&#039;re being really safe with these numbers. That&#039;s what you want to do. That&#039;s how the winners do it. The other type of people are the ones who don&#039;t plan anything and they dream of big things but then they just sit around in coffee shops and don&#039;t ever achieve anything. We want to be the type that gets it and that&#039;s how you get it.

We need to send out 400 direct outreach messages to get two clients. We can see how that process filters down here. Now here on the right, it says the number of days. Obviously, because we&#039;re planning a 30-day attack, we need 30 days or we have 30 days. Now the average number of sales calls per day is one because we need to do 20 sales calls. That&#039;s how you can check yourself each day as you&#039;re going through your 30-day action plan. You should be doing around one call per day on average. If you didn&#039;t do one call in the first 15 days, then you know that something is going wrong. That&#039;s why these numbers are good.

Then the number of engagements per day average, so you should be getting around two engagements a day, that&#039;s two people replying or showing some interest in your direct outreach messages. You also need to send 13 direct outreach messages each day. If you send 13 every single day, you should get two people reply and then you should be able to turn that into about one scheduled call. If you do that one every single day, then you should end up with two clients at the end of the months. That&#039;s how it works. Now I&#039;ve even broken it down into the minutes. We&#039;re assuming that each direct outreach message takes up five minutes.

If it takes you longer than that, you can change that number to like 10 or whatever and it will adjust the entire spreadsheet for you. If it takes you five minutes per direct outreach message, then the total number of minutes per day needed to take action is 67. This is pretty cool. We&#039;ve planned to get two clients. We&#039;ve broken it down to figure out that we need to send 400 direct outreach messages. Now that might sound like a huge overwhelming amount of work but we see that it&#039;s less than one sales call a day really and that we only need to send 13 messages per day, each day. The total amount of time that it takes is about one hour.

If you&#039;re very focused and you just committed to doing the most important thing each day, it will only take you 67 minutes and at the end of the month, you should have two clients or more. You can see how this breaks it down. This is how we reverse engineer our goals. Now I&#039;m not going to go too far into it with the paid method because I&#039;m assuming most people are going to be using organic. This works very similar. You plug in the number of clients you want to get and today&#039;s date and here I&#039;m assuming you have a 20% conversion rate because I don&#039;t think anybody should go to paid methods without first practicing sales calls and things.

If you have a 10% conversion rate on your sales calls you&#039;re probably going to lose money on Facebook. Then I&#039;m assuming you have an 80% show up rate. That means that 20% of the people aren&#039;t going to show up or you might cancel 20% of the people because they&#039;re not a good fit. Then I&#039;m assuming your value video has a 5% conversion rate. If people watch your value video, 5% of them will schedule an appointment. Then I&#039;m assuming your landing page has a 20% conversion rate and your campaign, your Facebook advertising campaign has a 0.5% click-through rate.

These are all quite healthy numbers. This is assuming things are actually going well. In order to get two clients, you&#039;d need to have 10 sales calls. In order to have 10 sales calls, you would need to get 13 at survey applications. In order to get 13 survey applications, you would have to get 250 leads, that&#039;s 250 people to opt in for your funnel. In order to get 250 leads, you&#039;d have to get 1,250 clicks on your ad. In order to get 1,250 clicks on your ad, you&#039;d have to get a quarter million or 250,000 impressions. You&#039;d also have to satisfy this conversation rate here. That&#039;s how you reverse engineer that.

Then you plug in the price of your offer and it&#039;s different when we we&#039;re working with paid methods because we have cost involved. With organic methods, we don&#039;t really have cost involved and if we do, they&#039;re very small. With paid methods, we&#039;ve really got to watch ourselves because it&#039;s possible that you can lose money with paid methods. It&#039;s much less likely to lose money with organic methods. That&#039;s another one of the reasons why we start with organic. If we are aiming for two clients in 30 days, the number of sales calls we need a day is around 0.3. Less sales calls needed because we have a 20% conversion rate. Then the number of surveys we need per day average around half.

Number of leads per day, that&#039;s eight. We need eight people opting in to our funnel each day in order to get these targets. Number of clicks per day, we need 42. That&#039;s people clicking from our Facebook ads and going to our funnel. Number of impressions that we to serve each day, 8,333. As you&#039;re checking your metrics each day, you should be looking that you&#039;re getting around or close to these things here. Now, it&#039;s important that you don&#039;t judge any one day too harshly because of regression to the mean these things, swing both sides. You really want to look at four-day moving averages, better yet, seven-day moving averages because individual days can have some variance and some noise between them.

Then, over here, it calculates all of our different costs and everything. If we have all of these metrics here, that&#039;s how our campaign is performing, then I&#039;ll start from the top. If we were to get these metrics, our cost per call would be $350 per call and that would mean that our cost to acquire a customer would be 1,350. Our cost per survey would be 280, our cost per lead would be $14 and our cost per click on average would be $3. Our cost for every 1000 impressions would be $14. The total monthly cost for our campaign would be 3,500 which would be $117 in ad spend each day.

Now, why I&#039;ve broken all this stuff down is because it just makes people get really realistic here. Now, I know a lot of people, they&#039;re like, &quot;Oh, I&#039;m going to make a lot of million dollars with Facebook ads.&quot; That&#039;s all very well and everything but, okay, do you know how much money you need to invest in Facebook to be able to get that sort of return from it? A lot of people talk a big game and everything with Facebook but they don&#039;t look at the math. If you only have 500 bucks in your bank account, you can&#039;t really march over to Facebook and think that you&#039;re going to make some noise because it&#039;s just going to eat you alive.

Here I&#039;m showing you that in order to even really just break even and get two clients, you already need to have pretty good numbers in terms of your funnel conversion rates. You need to be closing pretty well. You need to spend $117 a day. That&#039;s going to be 3.5 grand. If you can&#039;t front a 3.5 grand bill or you can&#039;t float 117 bucks a day on your credit card, then Facebook isn&#039;t really going to be an option for you. If we were to get all of these numbers here, our total revenue collected would be 4 grand. Our total cost incurred would be 3.5 grand. That means that we&#039;d make a profit of roughly 500 bucks.

Now you might think that&#039;s not very much and you&#039;re right. The reason why these numbers are like this is because really, this offer is too cheap for Facebook. Also, these numbers aren&#039;t really good enough. Like you&#039;ll notice if I change this to 4,000, the numbers will change a lot. When I change the number, my price for my offer to 4 grand, my ROI and everything shot up exponentially. You can see that I would have collected $8,000 in revenue and my total cost incurred would only be 3.5 t. I pretty much make 4.5 grand which is pretty good.

You can see down here, my ROI is 63%. However, when I take it back to 2 grand, I&#039;m actually making a loss. I&#039;m losing a grand. I created these formulas here, really, to just bring a lot of clarity to these forms of advertising for you guys because I think a lot people, they&#039;re just not very realistic when it comes to what&#039;s required to achieve big things? When you reverse engineer your goals like this, it brings everything to light. You can see exactly what is required. Because these numbers work this way, I highly recommend starting with organic methods.

Once you&#039;ve got some money coming in and you&#039;re actually starting to make money, Facebook is awesome. It will just ratchet up your entire business and you&#039;ll start scaling. In the beginning, Facebook can just be a scary thing that really just eats your money if you don&#039;t know what you&#039;re doing, and that is why I recommend organic.

We&#039;ll get back to our slides just here. That is the reverse engineering success spreadsheet. Very simple if you only have to plug in your numbers for organic, gets a little bit more complicated when dealing with paid. Now you know how to take your monthly target and break it down mathematically into daily actions. Now I want to introduce you to my secret weapon. Setting targets and then reverse engineering all the way back to daily actions is a big part of it. That&#039;s a big part of the edge that I have and a big part of my secret weapon. There&#039;s something else that gives me the edge and that is something that I call war maps. I use war maps to plot my daily action from a bird&#039;s eye view and keep track of my progress. It&#039;s how I navigate my way each day and make sure that I end up achieving my goals. This is what my process looks like when it comes to really planning my strategy and plotting my attack.

I like to start with big picture thinking. This is the mindset sort of stuff. It&#039;s like dreaming out into the future, setting your vision, mission, all of that stuff. I&#039;d like to think 10 years out, then five years out, then two years out and then one year out. When I think 10 years out, I&#039;m not really calculating any numbers. It&#039;s lofty thinking. Same with five and same with two, it&#039;s pretty lofty. I&#039;m not even setting any data points. However, with one year targets, I start to bring a lot more clarity to those. I start to focus on my one year. Anything beyond that and it&#039;s just a brief thought.

Then step two is to come up with specific targets and goals for the next 12 months which is what we do once we set our one-year goals. Then I like to reverse engineer those 12 months targets to monthly targets. I showed you how to reverse engineer just then using reverse engineering spreadsheet. If you want to achieve a target by the end of the year, you can break it down into the different months and you can see what&#039;s required each month to achieve that one year goal, that&#039;s how you do it. Right now, we&#039;re really just focusing on the next 30 days for you guys.

Then our reverse engineer, those monthly targets to daily actions and then I plot those daily actions on a war map ready for daily execution. Once I have those daily actions plotted on a war map, all that&#039;s left to do is violent daily execution and iterations to the war map when necessary. Like I said, it&#039;s just executing. Once you have set up your war map, all that&#039;s left to do is take action. Then once every 60 to 90 days, I come back to my war map, reflect, I make some iterations and some adjustments and then I go back to taking action. Anything more than that, anymore work on your war map and your plan and you just procrastinated.

What does a war map look like? You might be thinking. Well, let&#039;s take a look right now. I&#039;ve decided to share the actual war maps that I use with you guys. This war map calendar allows you to plan your entire year from a bird&#039;s eye view, 30,000 foot up on top and then it really takes it all the way down into the granular daily action items every single day. When you&#039;re running your business and you&#039;re trying to achieve your goals, it&#039;s important that you&#039;re able to switch back and forth between like granular daily action items and hourly action items and then flip back to kind of one year, three year sort of view.

You&#039;ve got to get really good at flicking back from like macro to micro when it comes to looking at your strategy because you&#039;ve got to go down into the micro stuff and take action to actually make any progress but then you&#039;ve got to flip back to the macro view and think, &quot;Am I heading in the right direction?&quot; You&#039;ve got to really become skilled at flicking between these two minds because the person that just gets really focused on the micro view and is just hammering at different things each day, often just takes action in circles and never really goes anywhere. However, the person that&#039;s too obsessed with the macro view never takes any action.

If you really want to be dangerous in business, it&#039;s a fine balance between the two things. You&#039;ve got to be able to flick between the two. That&#039;s something I&#039;ve become really good that. I can go from being big picture and thinking in terms of strategy and everything and then I can flick right back down into the granular stuff and actually start executing. This war map allows you to become a real beast when it comes to that sort of stuff. Let&#039;s check it out right now. It&#039;s available for download beneath this video in the resources section. It&#039;s an Excel file, you can open it with Microsoft Excel or you can open it using Google Docs. I recommend Google Docs. Once you&#039;ve opened it in Excel, just click this blue link here and it will open up in Google docs. Save it to your Google Docs. Have an online copy. It&#039;s a thousand times better. I don&#039;t even know why anyone would use it in Microsoft Excel.

The beauty of having this thing on your computer in Google Docs is you can just bookmark it. Anytime you want to look at your war map, you can just click on the bookmark and it will open it up. You can even check it out on your phone or whatever. Share it with your teammates. It&#039;s really effective. This is what it looks like. You can see there&#039;s a number of tabs down the bottom here. It starts with dashboard and then it goes through all the different months in a year. A dashboard view shows us the entire year from a bird&#039;s eye view from January all the way to December. What we&#039;re looking at here is every single day in the entire year. What&#039;s pretty amazing with this is it&#039;s a lot less. It looks a lot smaller than most people think.

Quite often you think of a year when you think about it like emotionally and without bringing clarity to it, it feels like a long time. You feel like you can pretty much achieve anything in a year. Then by the time you look at it like this and you actually look at the days, you&#039;re like, &quot;Wow, it&#039;s so small.&quot; This is why I like to have this view. You might be thinking why have I made my own calendar? Why don&#039;t I just use Google calendar? Well, Google calendar doesn&#039;t give you a view like this. You try and make it give you a view like this, it doesn&#039;t do it. You can&#039;t make changes to it as quickly as this. This thing outperforms it.

What we do is we can get a clean bird&#039;s eye view of the entire year. Then we can plot in our key projects and key initiatives that we&#039;re working on. How we do that is with this key over to the right here. I&#039;ve put one in here as just a sample. You can delete it when you open up yours. You can see this brown-red color here which is taking up Jan 1st to Jan 10th. It says example, building website and funnel. This is how you work with this thing. You can select like certain number of days, so let&#039;s say I want to work from the 12th to the 14th and I want to complete. Let&#039;s say I want to … What could I do? I could complete my website and my funnel. I could type in here, website and funnel build out. Then I said 12th to the 15th. We can make that red.

You just click on this little bucket here and you could select red. Now we know, when we&#039;re looking at this, we can just look at the color and associate it with the key. Because it&#039;s obviously too small to type individual things and these little pieces here and so the colors work really good. Now you don&#039;t plot daily actions in this bird&#039;s eye view dashboard. This is only for key initiatives, big things, things that take one day or more. That&#039;s what you plot in here. Things like completing this training program if you&#039;re just getting started and you&#039;ve got quite a lot of training to get through and quite a lot of action items to do or block out the time, plot it, how much time it&#039;s going to take you to watch all of this training and get clued up on everything.

Then, you might need to plot out the build time. You need to build out your website, set up your stripe account, register your business. You need to practice your sales script. You need to build out a lot of assets in order to be able to go to market with your business, so you can plot your build time. Once you&#039;ve plotted the time, it takes you to go through the program and then build time to build out the key assets then you can plot where your 30 days of action is going to be.

Now, I&#039;m just going to assume here. I&#039;m just going to make this up but let&#039;s say I&#039;m starting like I&#039;ve got about two weeks left of training to go, I&#039;m going to go ahead and mark this as red. I&#039;m going to call this completing training program. Then after that, I&#039;m assuming it&#039;s going to take me two weeks to build out all of my assets. I&#039;m going to mark that as orange and I would call this here building out website, funnels, et cetera. Then after that, I might give myself a two-day buffer just in case I make a mistake. It&#039;s always good to give yourself some buffers because plans always change. Things take longer. Sometimes things go faster than we think too. It&#039;s always good to leave some buffers in here. My first 30 days of action, I&#039;m going to go from April 13th, so I&#039;m going to go ahead and make this yellow. I have to make these yellow too.

I&#039;m going to go from April 13th all the way through here to May 15th, let&#039;s just say. Oh no, that&#039;s 30 days. I&#039;m just going to guess it as it is. You can actually count yours. My first 30 days of action is going to start April 13th and it&#039;s going to end May 15th. It won&#039;t really end, I mean we&#039;re going to go and keep taking action but this is where my first 30 days of action is going to happen. I can plot this in here, first 30 days of action. You get the point by now. You know how to use this war map. You can see how simple and easy it is to use. It&#039;s pretty amazing that this thing really outperforms all the calendar software I&#039;ve ever tried.

I&#039;ve tried every single different type of calendar software and I can&#039;t find anything that will do what I wanted to do when it comes to this war map stuff. In the end, I just built my own thing and I decided to share it with you guys. You want to go through and plot all that stuff in and then you can really drill down into the granular months. Once you&#039;ve plotted it from the bird&#039;s eye view, we go down into another view, which is the monthly view. If I&#039;m going to say that we&#039;re taking from March 21st to March 30th, I&#039;m going to be completing the training program. If I go to March 21st, that&#039;s where I said I was going to start.

What am I actually going to do on the 21st? It&#039;s all very well marking it red and saying I&#039;m going to work on the training program. What am I actually going to do? How can I take something off? How can I make it an objective? I&#039;m going to type in here, I&#039;m just going to say, &quot;Watch two week four modules and complete two week four action items.&quot; You can go in and plot your individual things that you actually want to achieve because it&#039;s all very well plotting it up here and saying, &quot;Aye, it&#039;s going to take us two weeks to complete this.&quot; What are you going to do each day? When you wake up on March 21st, what are you going to do?

Well, that&#039;s why we can go from a bird&#039;s eye view here and then we can go zoom right in and see exactly what we need to do, makes it a lot easier. You can also see if you&#039;re fooling yourself with your goals and targets and things like that when you have to break things down. This is really good, this monthly calendar because you can just type different objectives in on each line here. Very easy, very simple to use. You&#039;d actually write the exact name of the module and the exact name of the action items here. I just made them up for this demo&#039;s sake.

On your first 30 days of action here … Oh actually, with this orange thing here where we&#039;re going from April 1st to April 10th, you would want to … We&#039;ve plotted here building out website funnels, et cetera. However you really want to break that down. On April the 1st, if I go here, what am I actually doing each day? Like what am I actually going to build? Am I going to finish my slides here for my value video? Am I going to finish my slides and do my recording? Am I going to set up my domain name and website? Get specific. Plot the actual things you&#039;re going to do. You can start with the big picture and then you can drill down into the more granular picture.

This is the first 30 days of action, the yellow here. It&#039;s going to start from April 13th. If I go to April 13th, here&#039;s the first day of action. What am I actually going to do? I calculated here if I want to get two clients, that means I have to send out in 30 days 400 messages. Four hundred messages over 30 days is 13 messages each day. That should take me 67 minutes. I need to send out 13 direct outreach messages. I might calculate that I want to send out 10 emails and then three of them as lumpy mails. You get the point. You want to plot out exactly what you&#039;re going to do each day of those 30 days.

Like I said, start from the big picture then drill down to the smaller picture. You don&#039;t have to plot out the daily actions for your whole year, no one does that. I don&#039;t do that because things change. What you do want to do is plot out daily actions for 30 days out. These are just revenue-generating tasks. Obviously, we&#039;ve got room to do other tasks. These are just the things that must get done in order to achieve our goals. That is the war map calendar. It&#039;s available for download. Now that you have set your target number of clients for the month and reversed engineered that target to define your daily actions, let&#039;s plot your daily actions on your war map right now.

Here&#039;s what you need to plot. Here&#039;s the process for plotting everything on your war map. I showed you some of this just before but here&#039;s the proper process you want to follow. The first step is to block out all of the days where you can&#039;t do anything because of a mandatory commitment. You start from the big picture here. Let&#039;s say there&#039;s just some days where I absolutely can&#039;t work, I might have obligations with my family, with my parents, I might have an operation, I might be on an airplane for 18 hours.

The first thing you want to do when you&#039;re plotting your war map is block out the days which are just pretty much no goals. Nothing&#039;s going to happen on those days. We want to get those blocked out first. Once those are blocked out, now you know what time you&#039;ve got left for other things. If you&#039;re not really to go to battle and start approaching your market just yet, then all you really want to plot is your learning time and your build time. I know some people might not be ready to go to market and actually start getting customers yet, that&#039;s fine. What you want to plot is just your … I&#039;m going to remove this just quickly. All you want to plot is just your learning and build time. I&#039;m also going to remove this demo stuff from here.

This red here from the 21st to the 30th, it says completing training program, so that&#039;s my learning time. First thing you want to do is plot learning. Then it says building out website, funnels, et cetera. That is what I mean when I say plotting your learning and build time. If you&#039;re still going through the program, you&#039;re not quite ready to go to market, do that. If you&#039;re ready to go to battle and start approaching your market, then you want to define your 30-day attack window first of all. I&#039;m going to go ahead remove these things. I&#039;m assuming I&#039;ve already got all my stuff set up this time and I&#039;m going to plan, let&#039;s say, this current day, it&#039;s June 1st.

I&#039;m going to highlight June 1st to June 30th and I&#039;m going to make it this color and I&#039;m going to write here, our first 30 days of action, plot it. I&#039;ve plotted my first 30-day window, that&#039;s what I mean by window. Then once you&#039;ve done that, plot how many direct outreach messages you need to send each day for the entire 30-day window and how many are you going to send as lumpy mail and how many are you going to send as direct email or LinkedIn or Facebook messages. If my 30-day attach window is June 1st to June 30th, then I&#039;m going to go to June and here it is. I&#039;ve got the first to the 38th.

I need to plot in here what I&#039;m going to do each day. If I go to my reverse engineering spreadsheet and it says that I need to do to get two clients, I need to do 13 direct outreach messages. Well, I&#039;m going to plot in here … sorry, I was on June. This will need to go to June. I need to do 13 direct outreach messages and I&#039;m just going to say 10 will be direct email messages and three will be lumpy mail packages. Now, you need to plot these out for every single day. Every single day you want to plot. I&#039;m not going to bore you with me going through all of these different things here. The reason why these boxes are shaded this gray color here is because it&#039;s the weekend just to give you some perspective.

The reason why these are blocked out like this is because these days don&#039;t exist in this month. That&#039;s how it works. I&#039;ve also left some space for notes and things down the bottom. When you&#039;re plotting in what it takes to achieve your goals, plot what action you&#039;re going to do each day. Now, a really important thing, if you can&#039;t take action on one day like let&#039;s say Sunday is just out for me. Let&#039;s say Saturday and Sunday here I can&#039;t do anything or let&#039;s just say I&#039;m busy with kids or family, whatever. Now because I&#039;ve missed two days here, that means on this day here, I need to take three days&#039; worth of action because I&#039;ve missed two days of sending 13 direct outreach messages each day.

That means that I need to send 39 direct outreach messages. This is why I like this stuff, because it really is sobering to see what happens when you miss two days. If you just missed two days, that means you&#039;re going to send 36 things on the Monday. We calculated that it takes 67 minutes to do this each day. If I miss two days, then it&#039;s going to take me three-and-a-half hours on Monday. That&#039;s just when I miss two days. You can imagine what it would be like if you missed a week. It gets pretty bad. That&#039;s why consistency is so important. That&#039;s why plotting this stuff and sticking to it is key. That&#039;s why I&#039;ve designed this for you guys.

The next step, step five, how many organic Facebook posts are you going to do? Plot them on the exact days for the whole 30-day window. Remember, when we were talking earlier in this week, we were talking about organic methods and how Facebook posts are an awesome way to get clients. They are. You should plot them on here too. I&#039;m going to write here FB post because I plan to do a Facebook post then. Then let&#039;s say I&#039;m going to do one every three days, I might go FB post then I&#039;m going to wait another three days FB post and you could just plot this every 30 days here.

Actually, I was away with my family that day so I&#039;m going to do a Facebook post this day, Facebook post this day, Facebook post this day and you get the point. We&#039;re really plotting out what we&#039;re going to do for the whole month ahead of time. The reason why we want to plot it out ahead of time is because we can see what it&#039;s going to take to achieve our goals and we can set action items. Without doing that, no goal is every going to be achieved. That&#039;s what we do. We plot the organic Facebook post. I recommend as bare minimum doing like one every week, that&#039;s bare minimum. That&#039;s one every seven days.

Once you&#039;ve done that, are you going to be doing any List Farming webinars or JV webinars? These were two of the other organic methods that we shared earlier in week four. If you are, plot them on your war map. Let&#039;s say I&#039;m a little bit more advanced in my evolution as a consultant, I have a list that I&#039;ve accumulated and I&#039;m going to be doing a list farming webinar. Now, if you don&#039;t have a list, then obviously you can&#039;t do list farming webinar. You should already know this from the organic attraction methods training module. I&#039;m going to plot in here that I&#039;m going to do list farming webinar.

Then I might plot in here that I need time to build this out. I also need time to send the different emails to my list. You get the point. You can really plot out everything you need to do. Why this is so awesome is once you have this plotted, all you need to do each day is just wake up, walk to your computer and look. Okay. This is what I need to do. Let&#039;s do it. You don&#039;t go to your email inbox and see what new cool thing is in there. You don&#039;t go to your phone and start flicking through different notifications on apps. That&#039;s what poor people do. You walk to your computer and you open up your war map. That&#039;s what rich people do. It&#039;s a big difference.

The seventh step, it just says here, be honest with yourself. If you do, all of the daily actions on your war map will add up to the targets you set. If I&#039;ve set that I want to make a million dollars in June, well, with these actions, probably aren&#039;t going to happen. That&#039;s why I like war maps, it forces you to really be honest with yourself and we get to reverse engineer what it actually takes to achieve our goals. Then plot it each day. Then execute on it each day. We really leave no room for errors because we even account for margin of safety. Because if you remember we added a 20% margin of safety, so we even account for errors. We even account for human error, variations, all those sorts of things. This is proper strategic planning for people who really want to win.

What I want you to do is pause this video and complete these exercises right now. When I say these exercises, I mean you need to set your targets, you should know how many clients you want and at what price point. You need to reverse engineer that and see what it&#039;s going to take and then you need to download that war map, save it to your Google Docs and then I want you to plot in all of your different important things into your war map. If you&#039;re just getting started with this stuff, plot out the time it&#039;s going to take you to complete this program, plot out the time it&#039;s going to take you to build your assets.

If you&#039;re almost finished building your assets and you&#039;re ready to go to the market then plot out your 30-day attack window. When does that 30-day timeframe start? When does it end? Mark that down right now. Just pause this video, complete it. Don&#039;t continue watching this video until you&#039;re done. Do not keep watching this video until you have downloaded your war map and plotted your next 30 days. This is such important stuff here. If you&#039;re done, good.

Now, you might be wondering how do you know who to reach out to each day when doing direct outreach? It&#039;s all very well here on my war map calendar that I&#039;ve plotted down that I want to do 13 direct outreach messages, that&#039;s great. Who are these 13 people? How do I know who to send 13 direct outreach messages to? That&#039;s a very, very good point. There&#039;s a simple method we use to quickly build lists of people to contact within our niche. We call this organic list building. Organic list building is how we find people in our niche who are a good fit for our offer so that we can send them direct outreach emails or lumpy mail packages. Here&#039;s how it works. Here&#039;s the organic list building process.

When you need to generate a list of people to send direct outreach or lumpy mail to, follow this process. Step one, go to Google and search for phrases like niche in your city. Example, if my niche was plumbers and my city was New York, I could search for plumbers in New York. Now, I recommend when you&#039;re just getting started to start with your local city first. It&#039;s typically easier to find prospects in your local city and you typically have more confidence dealing with your local city when are you first start out. As you get more confident, you start to target nationwide, you start to target other countries.

If you have any confidence to target the whole world from day one, go for it. Don&#039;t let me stop you. I&#039;m just saying this for people who want my opinion and don&#039;t really know where they should target first. Now, if you&#039;re in a city which is not ideal to target, for example, you might live in the middle of nowhere. Well, you don&#039;t want to target your local city because there&#039;s hardly anyone there. You want to choose another city to target that&#039;s nearby and has a decent population and a decent sort of economy and market in it. You need enough people. Then you want to start going through the search results and checking out their websites and thinking to yourself, does this person or company fit my ideal client avatar?

Back in week one, we would have completed the client avatar worksheet. You should know exactly what your ideal client looks like, their different characteristics and traits and everything. When you&#039;re looking at these different search results and you&#039;re looking at these different websites, just ask yourself, does it fit my client avatar? If it does, then you want to, and step three, if they fit your ideal client avatar, extract the information you need and list them in your list building worksheet. I&#039;ll show you how to do that right now. Let&#039;s go through these steps and I&#039;ll do it live on my screen.

First step is to search in Google for niche in your city. I&#039;m going to go here and I&#039;m going to google.com and I&#039;m going to search for plumbers in New York. Here&#039;re the search results. Now we could look at the ads or we could come down here and we could look at the organic listings. Let&#039;s look at this Hub Plumbing NYC. I&#039;ll open it in a new tab. I could look through this site and think, does this person fit my ideal client avatar? Just for a demo in this video, I&#039;m going to say yes, this person or this company does. Then you go to your list building worksheet. This is available for download beneath this video. This one&#039;s a very simple one.

You can use it with Microsoft Excel or Google Docs. I do recommend Google Docs. I put an example in here. For example, I put ABC Plumbing and the source is Google Search, the ad link. If you find an ad like a yellow pages ad or you see an ad on the internet or anything and that&#039;s how you find a prospect, then what you should do is screenshot the ad and then you can put a link to it in here. This is just optional. You don&#039;t need to get that fancy unless you want to. I&#039;m just going to go N/A then the website URL, are they a good fit? Yes.

Then I&#039;m going to put their email in here, then their mailing address. Whether I sent them a message or not, what sort of message I sent them and then when I sent it. Right now, I&#039;m just going to use this example here. It&#039;s Hub Plumbing Inc. and so I&#039;m go to here, show them on this building and I&#039;m going to call it Hub Plumbing Inc., source Google Search, ad link N/A, website Hub Plumbing Inc., good fit yes, email. To find the email, I&#039;m going to have a look on their website. We&#039;re going to have a look around on here first then we can try contact us and they&#039;ve given us a form. Sometimes it&#039;s hard to find companies&#039; emails. You want to try a few different options.

I shared some different ways to do it. When you&#039;re looking for emails and mailing addresses, look at their website first and then you can try Google searching for different phrases and then you can take some educated guesses or simply call them and ask. Go back to this one here. I can&#039;t really find it anywhere on their websites but they do have a form. I can get their address though. I&#039;m going to get their address. I&#039;m going to drop that in here on the mailing address. Then for this, I&#039;m just going to go no for now and just put a dash there. I definitely haven&#039;t mailed these people and their email, I can&#039;t really find it.

In this case, we could try a few different things. First of all, we could try searching it for the email just in Google. We could guess that it might be contact at hubplumbinginc.com. If I just try this, if I just try Googling for this, sometimes you can find it. We&#039;re looking for any search results where we have this person&#039;s email. I could try email at hubplumbingincnyc or I could just try some different things here. Here we go. I can see his email. This is on LinkedIn. This is perfect. I can see here that this is a guy called jwood and his name is John Wood and he lives in New York. He&#039;s the owner at Hub Plumbing and Mechanical NYC.

He has his email, <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="fd568a929299bd90889f8d5688909f94939ad39e9290d3">[email&#160;protected]</a> See, if you do some searching around, you can find these things. It just takes a little bit of effort. When I go back to my list building sheet and paste his email right there. That&#039;s how I extracted the information. I got the company name, the source. I got the website URL. I determined whether they are a good fit or not. I got the email off the owner, also got the LinkedIn and I got the mailing address. I added them to my list. Now, I could do a few things here. I could send John Wood an email or I could send him a lumpy mail package or I could send Adam as a connection on LinkedIn and send him a message on LinkedIn.

I&#039;ve got three options to market to somebody and I found their record and got that option just by searching in Google, just for niche in my city. You can do that for hundreds of records. That&#039;s how you do it when you&#039;re starting out. That&#039;s what I did, that&#039;s how I used to get all of my clients. We&#039;ll return back here and that&#039;s how you build your list. Every morning when you are executing on your war map you might wake up the morning of Thursday, June 1st, and it&#039;s day one of your action, your 30-day action plan. You will walk to your computer and see that you need to send 13 direct outreach messages. Ten are going to be email. Three are going to be lumpy. You&#039;re also going to do a Facebook post.

Okay. The first thing you need to do is build a list of 13 people in your niche that you&#039;re going to send messages to. To do that, you open up your list building sheet and we need to get this list here to 13. I&#039;m going to keep going through Google search and I&#039;m going to keep looking at different plumbers in New York and I&#039;m going to keep adding their company names to this list and I&#039;m going to extract their information just like I showed you. I did no preparation for extracting that information from Hub Plumbing Inc. You saw how I did it. I couldn&#039;t get it on the first go but I tried a few little iterations, a few little hacks in Google to try and find out who was behind it and who at the email.

You can pretty much find anyone&#039;s contact information if you just try it and you try a few different angles. The final option if you can&#039;t find anything is you can just call them and ask or you could have entered their web form on their website. When you do week one properly and you really do craft a powerful consulting offer, it doesn&#039;t really matter how fancy your method is for contacting the business owner because we&#039;ve chosen something solid. People want help with this. Remember that we are helping these people saw the painful problem. When they hear our message, their ears should pick up and they should be responsive and want to chat with us.

That&#039;s why it doesn&#039;t really matter sometimes how we get our message across, provided it gets across. That&#039;s how you do organic list building. Now you have set your targets. You&#039;ve reversed engineered them back to the daily actions and you&#039;ve plotted the daily actions and have everything necessary to execute on the daily actions. You really have everything at this point. Now it&#039;s time to go to war. However, some people seem to get stuck at this stage. This fascinated me for a while. I was like, how can people have their niche, they offer everything ready, how can people have done some mindset stuff too and how can people have built out their key assets, assembled the war machine ready to go and how can they even have the action plan set for the 30 days and yet somehow they just don&#039;t act on the items in the action plan.

I was like, what is going on? These people, they know what they want. They know what&#039;s required to get it and they know what they need to do, yet somehow they just can&#039;t seem to take action each day. This thing plagues some people. Here&#039;s a cool hack I learned to make the daily execution of revenue-generating activities an ingrained habit instead of a dreaded task. This is how you hack your brains habits. Your brain is just a habit machine. If you think you do what you do at your own free will each day, well I&#039;m sorry to tell you that you don&#039;t. You pretty much have no free will. Everything you do is pretty much just habits.

Until you learn how to hack your habits, then you are at the mercy of whatever&#039;s already programmed in there. Here&#039;s how your brain forms habits. It&#039;s very simple. First of all, the brain has a trigger and this is an event or a sound or a stimulus or something that the brain recognizes and it&#039;s an event for the brain. It&#039;s like, aha, I can see the stimulus or I heard that noise or it&#039;s a time in the day. It&#039;s some sort of event that marks a sequence. You&#039;ve got the trigger. Then you&#039;ve got the action. When you see this stimulus and when the brain receives this trigger, it takes this action. A good example is, if you&#039;re driving on the road and some kid walks out into the road, that&#039;s going to be the trigger.

The action is that you&#039;re going to swerve the other way. That would be the action. That&#039;s hard wired into your brain. That&#039;s a habit. You don&#039;t even think about that. It just happens. I&#039;m sure it&#039;s happened to some people. I&#039;m sure everyone who&#039;s driven a car has had some experiences like that when something happens and they act and they don&#039;t even know how. They don&#039;t even think about it. It was so fast. It was just boom. Well, that is something that&#039;s really been trained and burned into your brain. That&#039;s a really powerful habit. When you see the trigger, the action happens.

Then afterwards, you have the reward. This is what happens after you do the action. Then what happens is the brain associates the trigger to the reward and it does that through feedback. If a kid steps out into the road and the action is to swerve and then I miss the kid and then the reward is whew, that was exactly what I needed to do. I&#039;m so glad I did that. That would be the reward, like a feeling of relief. That&#039;s the feedback signal that you&#039;re giving to your brain and it&#039;s going to go back and associate that to the trigger. Now the brain knows that if it sees that again, it needs to take that action because if it takes that action, it&#039;s going to get that reward.

The brain it&#039;s just a never ending pattern recognition tool. If it sees different stimulus, it formulates different actions and it does that based on the reward it&#039;s going to get. Another example is if you&#039;re horrified of doing sales calls, well you probably have a pattern burned into your brain which is like the trigger is talking to strangers. Then the action is that you&#039;re just terrified. You&#039;re petrified. It might be because when you were younger or you&#039;re shy or something or you were picked on at school and so whenever it comes to talking to strangers, inside you, you have all these emotions rush up to the surface and they&#039;re like, don&#039;t do that, no don&#039;t do that. That&#039;s the action that happens.

Then the reward is you don&#039;t do that and that&#039;s how your brain works. These things can become real powerful like when you were younger, one of these things might have actually helped you out a lot or when you&#039;re driving your car and a kid steps out onto the road, these sorts of things are going to help you out a lot. When it comes to business, sometimes the way you&#039;re brain has formed these different habits, it just wreaks havoc with you. I&#039;m going to show you how that happens in just a sec. First of all, I wanted to show you how your brain forms these habits, trigger, action, reward. Three sequences and the brain links them all up.

Let&#039;s take a look at a habit forming. This is an example of a habit forming and getting stronger. For this example, just imagine that you are like learning how to play basketball. You&#039;re going to training again and again and again. You keep shooting hoops. Let&#039;s say this particular pattern is shooting a basketball hoop from the three-point line. You step up to the three-point line, you have the ball in your hand, that&#039;s the trigger. The action is that you have to shoot and the reward will be that you either get it in or you don&#039;t get it in. That&#039;s going to provide either positive or negative feedback and it&#039;s going to create that sequence of events.

Now if you mess slots and you really beat yourself up and you really let it get to you, then next time you step up to that three-point line, you&#039;re going to feel all of these emotions rush up because your brain doesn&#039;t want you to do the action because it knows that it&#039;s been here before and it didn&#039;t end well so it&#039;s trying to get you away from it. However, if you&#039;ve had all these awesome experiences and the brains received all the sort of positive feedback, next time you step up to the three-point line, it&#039;s saying let&#039;s go, you&#039;ve got this.

It can happen both ways and it happens through these three events and sequence with feedback over a period of time. Now, here in this quick example, I&#039;m going to show you how someone&#039;s pattern might start off and then how it gets really strong over time. When you first start doing anything for the first time, you&#039;ve got to think about it a lot. When you first shoot a three-pointer, you&#039;re going to be thinking, oh should I grip the ball like this, this, should I push this hard? You&#039;re going to be thinking too much and you&#039;re pretty much going to mess it up. If you were to look at your brain, it&#039;s going to be sort of firing the trigger-action-reward sequences this fast which is still kind of fast.

As you keep doing it again and again and again and again and again and again, it just speeds up. This is what training does. The more you train, the faster these sequences burn into your brain. When you start getting like Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant, good, this is what&#039;s going on when you&#039;re playing basketball. It&#039;s way too fast to even think. There is no thinking involved, it&#039;s just happening. That&#039;s what training does. Why I showed you that? The more times the trigger-action-reward sequence fires, the stronger the habit gets. Here&#039;s what most people&#039;s habits look like. These things are strong.

This is most people. Trigger is to wake up. They wake up each morning with an alarm clock at 6 or 7 a.m. The action is to go to work. They have a shower, they get changed, they get dressed and everything. They might grab a coffee and then they go to the office and they&#039;ve got to be there at 9 a.m. and then they start working. Then they get home from work at say 6 p.m. and then their reward is watch TV. They quite like watching TV and eating pizza or whatever. That&#039;s sends positive feedback signal back and the brain quickly learns this pattern of events. When you wake up, the brain just says, &quot;All right, we&#039;ve got to get to work.&quot; Then wants to finish all the work so it can get home and watch the TV and eat the pizza and then this just happens again and again and again and again, it burns into your brain.

Most start out entrepreneurs&#039; habits look like this. This is a big one for entrepreneurs. I see this in almost everybody. The trigger is they wake up. The action is to go to their email inbox and read their favorite blogs. First in the morning, they walk to the computer, they check out their Facebook, they check out their Instagram, they check out their email. Then they go to all the different blogs which are posted like 10 different posts each. Then they check out the authors of those blogs, social media accounts.

By the time they&#039;ve done all of that, it&#039;s pretty much 7 p.m. and the day is over and they feel really productive because they have read a whole bunch of stuff and they&#039;ve kept up to date with everyone else but they haven&#039;t really done anything. Then the reward at the end of the day is to buy a new microphone or a pair of wireless Apple headphones or some other new shiny object which makes them feel even better for doing absolutely nothing for the entire day. The pattern and the habit burns a cable into the brain just like this. I see this in almost every entrepreneur.

When you take a person who&#039;s had wired to procrastinate, it takes some effort to get them to take action and to be completely honest, when I was starting out, I was plagued by this too. Here&#039;s how I hacked it. Here&#039;s how I hacked my brain to take action. My trigger was to wake up. When I woke up first thing in the morning, I knew that I needed to just walk in to my office, which was my parent&#039;s garage, and look at my war map. I would pull it up on my computer and I&#039;d look. Okay, I need to send 10 direct outreach messages. Then my brain would sort of do a little thing and it would go, what should we do now? It&#039;s like I had the thoughts, oh let&#039;s read this blog or let&#039;s do this or let&#039;s do this.

I was able to discipline my mind. I was like, no, no, no, no. We just need to do what&#039;s on this war map. I sent out the different direct outreach messages. The reward I gave myself once I&#039;d done that was I went to my favorite coffee shop and I got a latte in the sun, just like I [inaudible 01:35:07] all the coffee in the sun. This was back in New Zealand. At first, it was really hard for me to do this. It was so hard for me to take action because I had burned a habit into my brain to just procrastinate and do nothing. I was that person that woke up and then read blogs all day and then bought up a new pair of Apple headphones when I was done reading all of the blogs.

I did that for about a year. When it came to actually trying to do something meaningful, all the emotions and everything just was screaming at me inside my body. This is what happens to people. It&#039;s just these patterns and these habits that are just hard wired in there. At first, it took every piece of effort I had to just execute on my war map. When I started doing this again and again and again, within the first 30 days, this new habit formed. What was amazing is this new habit became so powerful after about 30 days that I couldn&#039;t actually like live without doing it. When I woke up in the morning, the first thing that my brain thought off was just executing on a war map.

I didn&#039;t even want to go and read any blogs or do anything. I just wanted to do that. It&#039;s like if I didn&#039;t even need to do that and I wasn&#039;t doing it, almost felt guilty not doing it. It&#039;s amazing how I could take something that was a huge fear and something I never wanted to do and turn it into its opposite. This is just proof that any sort of emotion you have is just nothing. It&#039;s just habits. You can override and rewire absolutely everything in your brain. It just takes some effort and it takes some planning.

Here&#039;s what I learned hacking my brains habits. The first thing is you need to starve your mind of all the old triggers, actions and rewards. My mind had all of these things. I will subscribe to 50 different email lists, I had like every app on my phone, I had so many notifications and I was in so many different group chats and so many different Facebook groups with so many different people who all weren&#039;t doing anything that it was just like festering all the time. The first thing you want to do is just delete and remove and hide and get rid of everything you can. Delete all the apps on your phone. Delete social media accounts. If you&#039;ve got Snapchat, that thing is a procrastinator&#039;s dream. That thing cannot be good for your brain. Most social media isn&#039;t good for your brain.

Text messages, all of that stuff, you just want to get rid of all of that stuff because it doesn’t make you any money so why are you doing it? It&#039;s not very fun to do either. It&#039;s just gotten out of control. Then the second one, never start your day with admin tasks like email, Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram, texts, chores and those all to-dos. One of the huge things I learned is when you start your day, what you do in that first 30 minutes pretty much sets the pattern for the rest of the day. If the first things you do in the day is like email and Facebook and LinkedIn, then for the rest of the day, all you&#039;re going to want to do is keep going back and checking email, Facebook and LinkedIn.

It&#039;s like you can&#039;t not check it. It&#039;s burned into your brain like that. That&#039;s what happens. That&#039;s why it&#039;s so important to do your executing on your revenue-generating activities first thing. I don&#039;t check my email first thing in the morning. These days, I check my email probably once every three, four days. Sure, some people get angry and everything. Sure, I miss some deadlines and stuff but I get my most important thing done. Make sure you don&#039;t touch any social media, any email, any little chores or to do&#039;s or anything until you&#039;ve done the main things. The best trigger is the moment you wake up before touching any stimulus.

As soon as you wake up in the morning, your brain is pretty fresh. It hasn&#039;t received any stimulus or anything that&#039;s going to trigger old patterns. The worst thing you can do to trigger old patterns is open up your email inbox seriously. Don&#039;t do that. I see people that are just obsessed with checking their email inbox and they can&#039;t even do anything. Then you want to execute on your war map&#039;s daily actions first thing in the morning before you touch anything else. Seriously, this will make a lot of difference. Delete everything off your phone. No apps or notifications, no pushing to your phone, nothing pushing to your phone.

With your email, make sure it doesn&#039;t push to your phone. Your phone shouldn&#039;t buzz or have a little red notification when it gets an email. You turn that off. You don&#039;t need to have anything notifying you on your phone. Also, stop texting. I don&#039;t text anyone. I don&#039;t have any text on my phone, sure the odd person might text me but I pretty much don&#039;t text them back unless it&#039;s important. I just stop texting all together because it was just a waste of time. It was another one of those activities that was just ruining my brain. You want to get used to deep focused work, not all of this erratic ADD work that so many people are obsessed with these days.

Delete all of the random software from your computer, clear your desktop completely and only have the apps you need. Look at my computer. Look how many software applications I&#039;ve got down the bottom, almost nothing. I also only use one screen. Lots of people have multiple screens these days. The reason why I only use one screen is because I don&#039;t want to have anything else other than what I can look at on one screen. I&#039;m trying to stick to just the thing I&#039;m doing, trying to be really focused. People praise all of this multitasking stuff these days but multitasking is really bad for your brain.

You should never ever do it. Clean up your entire computer. Honestly, these things might sound really small and trivial. You might be like, what&#039;s this got to do with making money. Seriously, it&#039;s just going to remove all of the little things that trigger you to do the things you shouldn&#039;t be doing. The more of these things that you remove, these are like little trapdoors. The more trapdoors you remove from your life, the less chance you have of falling down a snake like if you&#039;re playing snakes and ladders. Now just imagine like these things are little trapdoors and snakes. The more of them you remove, the less chance you&#039;ve got of getting caught by one of them.

Then when you&#039;ve really starved your mind of all of these old triggers, then the only thing that&#039;s got left to do and really think about is just doing what it should be doing which is executing on your daily actions. When that becomes your habit, you&#039;re going to be rich. I know it might seem a bit annoying like, &quot;What do you mean I got to stop texting? You mean I&#039;ve got to do all of these different things. Oh, do I have to delete my Angry Birds and Fruit Ninja app? You don&#039;t have to. If you want to be poor for the rest of your life, then keep it and keep playing it. If you want to be rich and successful, then get rid of it. Don&#039;t be a little kid.

Learn to use one computer screen. Only have one window open at a time and only have one to two browser tabs open at one time. I can tell how clean somebody&#039;s thinking is by how many browser tabs they have opened. If I go to someone&#039;s computer and they&#039;ve got like 50 browser tabs, I&#039;m pretty not going to listen to that person&#039;s advice ever because I know that person&#039;s brain must be an absolute mess. You want to just keep focused on one or two key things. One is best, sometimes though I know you need to have two browser tabs. These things might seem small but once you&#039;ve build this as a new practice, you will develop powerful habits where you just are able to do deep work on things instead of all of these scattered busy work which it feels great to do, don&#039;t get me wrong. Being really productive while doing all of these small trivial things, it feels awesome. You feel like you&#039;re really productive and you&#039;re absolutely crashing it but it doesn&#039;t lead anywhere. You&#039;re pretty much just a glorified personal assistant.

Let&#039;s form your habit right now. This is your new revenue-generating habit. This is a habit that is going to make you rich, actually. It&#039;s available for download, it&#039;s just a worksheet. It&#039;s a PDF. I recommend just printing this one out and it looks like this. When you print it out, just write in with a pen three things. What&#039;s your trigger going to be? What&#039;s your action going to be? What&#039;s your reward?

Now, your trigger is the thing that&#039;s going to tell you to do the action. I recommend if possible make this first thing in the morning. If you have a 9 to 5 job, I recommend waking up earlier. Try and train yourself to wake up at 4, 5 or 6 a.m. before work. The trigger should be wake up, walk to laptop, do. That should be the trigger. Wake up at 5 a.m. whatever, action should be to look at war map and execute daily actions from war map. Reward should be something that you really like that is going to be a reward for doing that. Now if you really like, for example, like playing Xbox or something, there is nothing wrong with that. You can use that as a reward.

If your trigger is wake up at 6 a.m. then your action is send out what&#039;s on the war map, let&#039;s say that&#039;s 10 direct outreach messages. Your reward could be 30 minutes or even one hour. To be honest, if you do all of that, you can take an hour off to just play Xbox and your brain is going to love that and that pattern is going to be burn in there. People who like doing things like playing Xbox or playing pool or during different things, if you just learn to put something in before you do that, you&#039;re going to be able to hack your entire brain and you&#039;re going to be able to be successful.

You must learn to put something in here. You don&#039;t like before the reward and your brain will just burn this new habit in there. I want you to pause this video right now, print this out, do this, stick it on your wall. This, you absolutely have to stick on your wall. This is going to completely change your life because the thing that separates people who do action items from the people who don&#039;t do action items, it&#039;s just habits. It&#039;s not will power, it&#039;s not more time in their day, it&#039;s not more intelligence, it&#039;s nothing. It&#039;s just habits. I&#039;ve seen people who are nowhere near as smart as other people just absolutely run circles around them just because they were able to form a habit.

Do that right now. We&#039;ve covered a lot of ground in this video. Let&#039;s bring it all together. Here&#039;s the different things we covered in the Planning Your 30-Day Attack module. Number one was the importance of planning your attack and making your first 30 days of action powerful and consistent. Like I said, the people who make five figures, six figures, seven figures and soon to be eight figures in this program, you could see the signs of that happening in their first 30 days of action. They have a 1000x advantage. That&#039;s how important your first 30 days of action are. You need to treat them seriously.

Number two, setting your target number of clients and revenue for you first 30 days of action. You should know that. It&#039;s simple. You just choose. If you don&#039;t know what you should aim for, aim for two. Then reverse engineering your target number of clients to see what daily actions are required. We used the reverse engineering spreadsheet to do that. We could see whether we were using paid or organic methods. What would actually go into achieving those results? They were able to reverse engineer it back to each day what we need to do each day. Once we know what we need to do each day, number four, we plot the first 30 days of action items on your war map calendar.

That was this right here, war map calendar. We start from the high level view, we color code things and then we drill down into the daily action items for our first 30 days. Then all we need to do in the morning when we wake up is look at this war map, see what we need to do and do it. That&#039;s it. Then we talked about designing your new habit so that executing on daily action items becomes a hardwired cable burned into your brain. I say a hardwired cable because this is what they&#039;ve found the brain works like. The more times you play that trigger-action-reward sequence in your brain and it fires those neurons, each time it fires that exact same sequence, the synapse get stronger.

Like the brain starts to mold itself so that it can relay that signal faster and more efficiently. The more times you do a habit, your brain is actually like mutating itself and changing. It can change in bad ways. You can form a ruthless habit to be a procrastinator and a ruthless habit to do absolutely nothing. However, you can hack your brain and make it a ruthless habit to just to do exactly what you want to do. That&#039;s how powerful that is and you should have completed the habit forming worksheet.

Now all that&#039;s left to do is take violent daily action. It doesn&#039;t matter how awesome your strategy and plans are if you don&#039;t take action. There will be obstacles and distractions at every step and turn that you can count on. People are going to demand your time, all sorts of people, friends, family, different people all over the place. They&#039;re always going to demand different things of you. Emails are going to stack up. That&#039;s definitely going to happen and chores and tasks are going to stack up and they&#039;re going to be neglected and you&#039;re going to start building up a pile of stuff that you&#039;re not doing and not really keeping on top of.

Here&#039;s the biggest thing I&#039;ve learned about focus. This is a pinup available for the download beneath the video. It says here, abnormal results upset normal people. I used to feel so bad about this for so long until I realized that this is actually the way it works. There&#039;re two sides to this really. You can either keep up with your normal person tasks or you can make progress with your dreams. However, you can&#039;t really do both. I will start with make progress with your dreams. This is things like working on your business, completing this training program, building out your assets, your website, your funnel, doing your sales call, sending out direct outreach messages, all of the stuff.

That&#039;s making progress with your dreams. Focused learning and this is deep work. Often this requires you to be alone. It requires you to just be behind your computer and you&#039;re neglecting this other side of your life when you do that. Up here in this little gray box that says, when you focus here, the other side turns chaotic and the ball gets dropped. People get angry at you and there is a feeling of guilt. This is true. When you start focusing most of your energy on this side, the other side starts to go real shaky and it starts to get like out of order. The other side is keeping up with your normal person tasks and these are things like email, social media, blogs, news, different catch-ups like having a coffee with someone.

The word catch-up isn&#039;t even in my vocabulary anymore. I used to catch-ups all the time until I pretty much learned that they were just a big waste of time and there really wasn&#039;t anything to catch up on. It was just some weird habit. Then these dinners, going out to dinner parties and stuff, then these partying like going out in the weekend and staying out late all night, getting drunk, then these events, then there&#039;s all these group chats. There&#039;s like a thousand different messenger apps that people can create groups on these days. Then there&#039;s just friendly calls, like just calling people and chatting, skyping, all of that stuff.

When you focus on your dreams, you end up sucking at all of these other stuff. You pretty much end up not doing it. Me, I pretty much don&#039;t do anything from the other side. That means that all the normal people and I use the word normal people because these are people who just think that&#039;s all that life is, is doing these things. They all think that I&#039;m being irresponsible because I take 7 to 12 days to reply to the email because I never even read their social media message, because I don&#039;t read any blogs, because I don&#039;t look at the news and I&#039;ve no idea what&#039;s going on, because I don&#039;t do catch-ups and because I don&#039;t just want to go and grab coffee with people or go to parties or events.

I don&#039;t go to any events nor do I speak at events even when I&#039;m invited because it&#039;s just I&#039;ve got bigger things to do. I&#039;m focused on making my dream become a reality, not speaking at some event. I don&#039;t do group chats or friendly calls or anything. What happens is that side start to get shaky like my email inbox becomes unruly, I start sucking at social media, my website looks horrible, I&#039;m bad at all of the stuff. Then all of these people start messaging you and then they&#039;re like, dude, you need to focus on this, you need to do this, your social media sucks, Instagram is the new place to be.

Then you hear all of these people yelling at you because Gary V. says that Snapchat is the future of business and if you&#039;re not on Snapchat, your business is going to fail. I&#039;m telling you, the noise out there is insane. You don&#039;t need to do Snapchat. Your business isn&#039;t going to fail if you do Snapchat. You actually have more of a chance of succeeding and being rich is you don&#039;t do Snapchat. That just shows you how backwards the world is. Don&#039;t listen to those people. Like I said, developer a filter. Is the person rich? Then they might know what they&#039;re talking about but you don&#039;t assume always. If a person isn&#039;t rich, almost never listen to them when it comes to business advice.

Don&#039;t worry, if you upset normal people because it is necessary to do the bigger things. Then on the other side, if we are to just keep everything under control and keep up with our normal person tasks. When you focus here, you keep on top of everything, nothing gets chaotic, your inbox is always ruly. Everything is always clean and in order, you&#039;re always showing up to your different social gatherings on time, you&#039;re very timely and organized person, by most people&#039;s social standards or an impeccable citizen.

You keep the normal people happy. You probably even win little normal people awards but you never make any progress on your goals and your dream dies inside of you and it rots away. I couldn&#039;t figure this stuff out when I got started. I would focus on my dreams but then this other side would blow up and I didn&#039;t go back and try and patch this thing up. Then my dreams would be collapsing, then I&#039;d go back to the side and focus on it again and this other side would blow up and that&#039;s really when I realized that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. If you&#039;re going to focus on the big stuff, the small stuff you got to let go.

That&#039;s just how it happens. If you try and balance both, it just won&#039;t work. That&#039;s pretty much impossible to do both. As you&#039;re taking action, forming your new habits and smashing it down barriers on the way to achieving your targets. Don&#039;t worry about letting the other side scream. Every action has an equal and opposite reaction so when you focus on doing big things, don&#039;t be surprised that the small things start piling up and getting a little bit chaotic. At the stage of this program, you have everything you need to start taking action, getting clients and making money. The only thing left is for you to do it.

Let&#039;s do this. You have everything you need right now. You know what you need to achieve. You&#039;ve got your niche, you&#039;ve got your offer, you&#039;ve got absolutely everything, the sales script, you&#039;ve got the community. We&#039;ve worked out what you need to achieve in the next 30 days. We&#039;ve reversed engineered it down to the daily actions. We&#039;ve plotted the daily actions on your war map. We&#039;ve shown you how to form a habit so that you can do the daily actions every day and burn it into your brain. You have absolutely everything you need.

All that you need to do right now is just do it. If you commit to this for the next 30 days and you do it each day, then you&#039;re good. You&#039;re going to be successful with this and you&#039;re going to be rich. Let&#039;s do this. It&#039;s your time and I can&#039;t wait to see your results with this.
