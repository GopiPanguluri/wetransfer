                        Hey everyone, Sam Ovens here and welcome to the second video of week one in the Consulting Accelerator Program. This lesson is going to be on natural law and the consulting equation. These are two things that you definitely haven&#039;t heard of before. This is going to be a lesson that you want to pay close attention to. These two things are fundamentally important. Natural law is what governs, it&#039;s the law of nature, the law of how everything works. It&#039;s extremely important. It is probably the most important thing there is.

The consulting equation is the fundamental equation that consulting works on. If we boil consulting down to a simple mathematical equation, I&#039;m going to show you what it looks like and how it works so you&#039;re never going to be stuck in a situation where you can&#039;t figure things out, because this equation is quite literally responsible for everything. Very powerful lesson, so pay close attention and let&#039;s get right to it.

Here&#039;s what we&#039;re going to cover today. First of all, we&#039;re going to talk about what natural law is and why it is of extreme importance, then cause and effect and the governing equation of fractal evolution and human life. We&#039;re going to talk about cause and effect and how that comes into your everyday life as a human, as a business owner and as a starting out entrepreneur, and the governing equation, like the master algorithm of evolution. How does the human species evolve? How do animals evolve? How do plants and everything in the world actually evolve over time and what is that equation? It&#039;s really important to understand this.

Then, why most people suffer as a victim to life due to fallibility from three key things. We&#039;re going to talk about why most people suffer as a victim. Why do most people think, &quot;Oh, poor me,&quot; or &quot;Things are happening to me,&quot; or &quot;The world is against me,&quot; or &quot;I just seem to have bad luck.&quot; Why do people seem to think that? Why on the other end of the spectrum are there people that just seem to have the best luck in the world? What is fallibility? Humans, are we invincible or are we really fallible? Fallible, I&#039;m going to explain what that means and the three key things about why we are so fallible and how to fix that.

Then I&#039;m going to talk about the eighth wonder of the world. This is something that you haven&#039;t been using in your business or your life. This is something that we as human beings forget all the time. The eighth wonder of the world. Finally, I&#039;m going to introduce you to the consulting equation. So very similar to the governing equation of human evolution. I&#039;m going to show you the governing equation for consulting and how we can boil consulting down to a simple equation and figure out exactly what the solution is in any given situation or scenario, and how you can use it to create value as a consultant.

A lot of people, they think, &quot;How do you create value? How do you go out into the world and make money?&quot; Let&#039;s say I&#039;m in a poor situation right now, I&#039;m broke, I&#039;m living at home with my parents and I don&#039;t know much. I don&#039;t feel like I know anything. Okay, how do you go from that position where you are now to someone who does know something and being someone who can make money? That&#039;s what we&#039;re going to talk about with the consulting equation. This is a very important lesson, so let&#039;s jump to it.

What is natural law? I found this quote on natural law by Albert Einstein and he says, &quot;The harmony of natural law reveals an intelligence of such superiority, that compared with it, all the systematic thinking and acting of human beings is utterly insignificant reflection. What that means is natural law is so powerful, it&#039;s the governing laws of this entire universe. It&#039;s the governing laws of everything. Natural law is so powerful that is every single human being on the face of the earth got together and put their thinking minds together, it still would not have a chance compared to natural law. It is the most important thing but we seem to forget it sometimes.

Here is a couple of quotes from me on what I see natural law as. Natural law applies to every participant in the universe at all times regardless of any effort on their behalf. There is simply no escaping natural law. No human, government, culture or force can fight it or change it. In simple terms, natural law is the ultimate truth of existence. What I mean is that it doesn&#039;t matter if we&#039;re more evolved now. It doesn&#039;t matter if we&#039;ve got 1000 years of technology. It doesn&#039;t matter what technology we have. It doesn&#039;t matter if we&#039;re in a different culture, in a different society, if we&#039;re in a different country, it doesn&#039;t matter how hard we try, we can&#039;t change natural law. Natural law is just the fundamental truth of the universe.

As humans we go through life experiencing challenges, setbacks, wins and losses. Every experience provides us with feedback and the ability to acquire worldly wisdom that helps us do more of what works and less of what doesn&#039;t. This results in a happy life we&#039;re in full control of. The problem is that most people go through life repeating the same mistakes over and over again expecting a different outcome, then blaming other people or forces for their misfortune. Most people choose to believe a false reality that opposes natural law and they end up living sad existences they believe are out of their control.

The great masters of all time learned to observe their lives as a series of never ending scientific experiments. With each experiment they reflected on the outcome and learned from it. The person who lives in this way ends up getting closer and closer to the ultimate truth and lives a life and harmony with natural law. A person in harmony with natural law dreams of something then creates it. This is some quotes from me on what natural law is. You probably want to take a screenshot of this or print it out, you want to remind yourself of this.

As we go through life, we get feedback, we make mistakes, we fall over, we graze our knee and it hurts, and we learn. Okay, don&#039;t be so clumsy, or maybe when you&#039;re running around, don&#039;t have your eyes close or don&#039;t be looking at your phone when you&#039;re running across the road or something like that. When we fall over, when we make that mistake we get feedback. It&#039;s not a failure, it&#039;s feedback and the feedback is painful and we learn, okay, let&#039;s not do that next time. Then we blame ourselves, we&#039;re like, &quot;Yeah, I was clumsy. It wasn&#039;t someone else&#039;s fault that I fell over on the road and got a grazed knee,&quot; so we learn and we&#039;re able to grow. We make a lot of mistakes and we figure out what the truth is, then eventually we end up pretty much never falling over and grazing our knee and never cross the road while looking our phone.

A person who does that and a person who constantly reflects on things, and is constantly in search of what the truth is, lives an awesome life. However, there are some people, this is probably most people in the world who experience misfortune, then instead of taking responsibility from it and learning from it, they blame something else or they blame someone else. What happens is once you do enough of that, life&#039;s out of your control. Now you&#039;re looking to someone else or some other force as the only thing that can provide you with the life what you want. It&#039;s the governments fault, something is happening in the news, it&#039;s this event&#039;s fault, it&#039;s this other person&#039;s fault, it&#039;s my families fault, I don&#039;t have enough time. Whenever you put the blame on something which isn&#039;t you, that is when you become a victim.

The people who master everything in this world, they are people who take responsibility for things and when they fail, they reflect on it and they learn. When they learn what the truth is, they remember it. They remind themselves and they keep getting closer and closer to the truth. When you live a life very close to natural law, you quite literally dream of something and are able to create it in real life. That&#039;s what this program is going to teach you how to do.

I can quite honestly dream up something I want in the future and go about making that happen. I do, and I do it year after year. Sometimes it even surprises me. If you wonder how I got to this point where I made a significant amount of money, moved countries and got it into the apartment and everything, it didn&#039;t just happen. I designed it, I built it and it was built to plan, it was built to spec, just like you build a house. The way I was able to do it was by understanding natural law and understanding everything. That&#039;s what we&#039;re going to be talking about.

Quite simply, natural law is cause and effect. It looks like this, this simple diagram. This is a diagram you want to keep in your mind. You want to imprint this in your mind. This is all that life is. We have three stages, we&#039;ve got a thesis at the beginning, then an antithesis which is the red. We have two things, we&#039;ve got a thesis, then we&#039;ve got an antithesis which is the red thing, then the two come together, the two collide. That&#039;s what we see in this middle stage, then something becomes of the antithesis in contact with the thesis and that is the synthesis. The synthesis becomes the new thesis, it comes back around and it just keeps going.

This is really the law of nature, this is the law of the universe, evolution and everything. If you are in your current situation, then you come into contact with some sun, then you would be the thesis, coming into contact could be the antithesis, then the synthesis is going to be you sunburned or you with a tan right? It&#039;s all of these things, they follow this rule. This is basically the equation of cause and effect. If we have a situation and we apply something else to the situation, then something comes of that situation.

I know this might seem way too simple to even be of value, but this really is it. Most people think we&#039;ve overcomplicated everything. This really is the governing formula of all evolution and all existence. It can be reduced to a simple equation like this for us as consultants and for us as humans. C+PE^T=D. Now stick with me while I walk you through each one of these steps.

D is your dream. D is what you want. C is your current situation. P is your plan. E is your daily execution of that plan. T is time. That little upwards facing hat thing, that represents an exponent. An exponent is like when you put something to the power of something, it&#039;s a power law. If I put five to the power of ten, I get 9,765,625 and you&#039;re probably like, &quot;Whoa, how does five to the power of ten equal such a massive number?&quot; Yeah, this is what exponents do. It means it&#039;s five times five, then it keeps times&#039;ing upon itself. These are what we call power laws. These are the laws which earthquakes work on, like Richter scales. A lot of things work on these sorts of scales.

This is why if you look at the gap between the rich and the poor that follows a massive steep curve, it&#039;s like the rich keep getting richer and the poor keep getting poorer. That&#039;s why once you have a lot of money, it&#039;s way easier to make a lot of money because things compound. Most people don&#039;t take this into account. This is the equation of cause and effect and I&#039;m going to walk you through it. Don&#039;t worry if you&#039;re a little bit confused right now, but I&#039;m going to walk you through each step and show you how simple it is.

The main thing is people think that life just happens to them. People think that if someone gets rich it&#039;s lucky, or it&#039;s because they did something wrong. People have just gotten out of touch with reality. They don&#039;t understand that it&#039;s all actually quite simple and it&#039;s all cause and effect. We can use this equation and we can figure out exactly how to get to where we want to go. Let me show you, watch this.

Here&#039;s our formula. C+PE^T=D. My dream could be to have 1,000,000 dollars in the bank. C+PE^T=D, so I&#039;ve replaced D with 1,000,000 in the bank right? We all can define our dreams, that&#039;s the first step. We just need to think into the future. What do we want? What is our dream? This is the first step. Most people actually never even go about this. I&#039;m not kidding, most people don&#039;t even think, what do I want? If you don&#039;t think about what you want, then you&#039;re most certainly never going to get it.

If you go to the airport and you don&#039;t know where you want to go and you just walk into that airport and you just get on some random flight, you might end up in Africa. You might end up in Africa and you might go, &quot;Wait a minute, I didn&#039;t want to be in Africa.&quot; Yeah, that&#039;s kind of what happens to most people&#039;s lives. If you don&#039;t define what you want, if you don&#039;t go through life everyday with some kind of intent, then you&#039;re going to end up in some random place, then wake up one and and realize, &quot;Shit, this isn&#039;t where I want to be.&quot;

Step one is to define what you actually want. What is your dream? It can be anything, you just have to define something. You don&#039;t need to worry if it&#039;s wrong because you can always change it later, but you must define something. C+PE^T=Dream, that&#039;s one million in the bank, anyone can come up with that. Now, we define C. C is our current situation, so everyone can define that because current situation is what you have right now. That&#039;s what&#039;s in your bank account right now. If I have 500 dollars in the bank right now, then my dream if to have 1,000,000 in the bank, now all that&#039;s left of this equation is +P^T, now PE is your plan times your execution of that plan to the power of time. All right, so let&#039;s keep going.

I&#039;ve got 500 in the bank now, then here&#039;s my plan. Pick a niche, focus on acquiring the skills and knowledge in that niche, get clients, scale up and have a mentor times execution of that plan to the power of time equals one million in the bank. Now we&#039;ve got our current situation, we&#039;ve got our desired situation, our dream. Now we&#039;ve got a plan, something that we think can get us there.

The next step is to put an E which execution. There&#039;s no point in just having a plan, we need to execute on that plan, we need to do the work. The best plan in the world still won&#039;t do anything if we don&#039;t do it. We&#039;ve got our current situation, 500 in the bank, then our plan, pick a niche, focus on acquiring the skills and knowledge in the niche, getting clients, scale up and having a mentor times our execution of that plan, which is no TV today, no alcohol or parties today, saving and putting every waking minute into execution today, focusing on wild execution to the power of time equals 1,000,000 in the bank.

Now we&#039;ve filled out our whole equation and all we&#039;re missing is to the power of time. Here&#039;s our last piece, here&#039;s where we put to the power of time in. 500 in the bank, that&#039;s our current situation plus pick a niche, focus on acquiring the skills and knowledge in the niche, get clients, scale up, have a mentor times our execution of that plan, no TV today, no alcohol or parties today, saving and putting every waking minute into execution today to the power of 365 days, that&#039;s a year. If we put in that execution of that plan everyday for 365 days equals 1,000,000 in the bank.

Now, that is this equation. That&#039;s natural law and it&#039;s actually pretty simple. How come most people don&#039;t control their lives and live their dreams? Well, it&#039;s all to do with knowledge, memory and time. Here&#039;s why most people suffer as a victim to life. Here&#039;s why most people swear that it&#039;s more complicated than what I just said it was. Number one is knowledge. Most people don&#039;t seek the truth in things and they have no interest in gaining knowledge in worldly wisdom. Knowledge is literally power and without it, one will suffer immeasurably.

Knowledge really is the most important thing in the world. Without knowledge, you don&#039;t even know if you should be happy or unhappy. You could be unhappy and not know it, not know why. You completely have no idea what to do without knowledge. Knowledge is the most important thing. You need to understand yourself, you need to understand your mind, you need to understand how the world works and you need to understand how to find the truth. That is the most important thing.  Most people don&#039;t even want to learn, or they go to college and they think, &quot;My learning is done,&quot; or they get to a certain age and they think, &quot;Oh, I don&#039;t need to learn anything anymore.&quot;

The second one is memory. Most people believe their memories about past events are accurate and are not subject to misinterpretation and change. Our memories are dangerously fallible, but most believe them as fact and this is a huge one. Most people think that their memories of things are accurate and truthful. They don&#039;t think that memories change and they don&#039;t think that at the time which they stores their memory, they could have been wrong. What we&#039;re starting to find out about the human brain is that memories change. What happens as a human when you set a memory, you&#039;re a person and you&#039;re walking through life and you see something happen, then what happens is to store that memory in your brain, you need to reduced that experience down into a sentence.

You need to convert an experience into a sentence, into a string of words. Those words are using your language system like English, Chinese or whatever. You take this complex situation and you reduce it down to a sentence, like this thing happened. Someone did something mean to me, I fell over and it was all their fault, they&#039;re horrible. That&#039;s my memory of something, then we store that memory, but what happens over time is our language gets bitter and we learn different things about the world. At the time which we set that memory, our language might not have been developed enough to accurately store that memory, or our understanding of life might not have been the same and this new understanding of life means this memory was totally inaccurate.

This is happening a lot. We&#039;re finding that our memories of things are totally inaccurate. Human beings, as they develop and as they grow older, their brains develop. Their brains grow different neural pathways, adapt and fuse together. When that happens it can actually change memories completely. People need to understand this. Just because you can remember something being a particular way doesn&#039;t mean that it was that way. One of the most dangerous things humans have is their own memory.

A lot of people when they come into trainings and they&#039;re trying to become successful is they can&#039;t escape their past. They&#039;re constantly thinking back to their past. I&#039;ve heard a lot of people say, &quot;Oh, Facebook ads, I&#039;ve already tried Facebook ads and it didn&#039;t work, therefore Facebook ads don&#039;t work.&quot; Do you know how crazy that is? Someone&#039;s memory is telling them that they tried Facebook ads and it didn&#039;t work, therefore Facebook ads don&#039;t work. Well how come other people can make so much money with Facebook ads?

Someone could say, &quot;I tried some sales calls and they didn&#039;t work, therefore sales calls don&#039;t work, therefore I&#039;m not going to try sales calls again because they obviously don&#039;t work.&quot; Well, that&#039;s madness. Maybe they&#039;ve fused that in their memory, so they&#039;re saying that this thing is this particular way but they&#039;re completely wrong. It&#039;s very important that we understand that our memories are very fallible and most of the time human memory is completely wrong.

The third one and this probably the most important of all, is time. Most people can&#039;t associate cause and effect because the two are distanced from each other over time, where effect gives little clue in the short term, but exponential clue in the long term. Simply put, most people give up because they can&#039;t see effect from cause immediately, or they see effect from cause, but forget what actually caused it due to memory fading with time.

What I mean by this is someone takes an action now and they can&#039;t see an effect from that action. Someone might invest a whole day into starting their business, but they don&#039;t see a whole bunch of money come into their bank account, so they&#039;re like, &quot;Oh I know, this was a waste. This was a waste of my time. I spent a whole day on this thing and I didn&#039;t make any money, therefore it doesn&#039;t work.&quot; What people don&#039;t understand is that cause and effect are spaced out over time. If you take an action today, you&#039;re not going to see the full effect of that action until years down the track. You&#039;ll start to see some effect but you don&#039;t see the massive effect until later on down the track. It&#039;s the same about compound interest and I&#039;m going to talk to you about that in a minute.

We call this human fallibility. Knowledge, memory and time. The fact that humans don&#039;t have very good knowledge and they definitely don&#039;t seek out knowledge. The fact that human beings have horrible memories, but they consider their memories to be the absolute truth and fact. The fact that most humans don&#039;t understand how time works. Time compounds things. An action taken today has exponential effect in the future. If you just save a dollar every day now, all you&#039;re going to see is a dollar in your account, then another dollar in your account, but later on in your life that is going to be worth millions. Most people don&#039;t see that, most people are only looking in the short term and they can&#039;t see that.

We call this human fallibility. What we mean by this is that humans are fallible. You&#039;re fallible, I&#039;m fallible, all of us are. We are extremely fallible and it means that we make mistakes and we believe things that aren&#039;t even true. Let&#039;s look at time in more detail. Time is probably the most misunderstood forces in the entire world. I know that you might be thinking, &quot;Sam, why are you teaching us about something so basic. I know how time works, there&#039;s 24 hours in a day.&quot; Well trust me, you haven&#039;t looked at it this way before ... because you have never thought about time like this before because no one else will have ever told you about this.

Here&#039;s effect versus time. Here&#039;s what it looks like. It follows an exponential curve. If I take some sort of action now, right now today. I&#039;m going to start my business, put in a whole bunch of research and all of this stuff. I&#039;m only going to see a very small effect today. I might look at my piece of paper and I might be like, okay, good, I came up with five pages of niche research, where&#039;s my results. That&#039;s all I&#039;ve got, just these five pages? Well, over time that effect starts to look like this.

Quite often, earlier in my journey, I was working on things and I couldn&#039;t see the reward right away. I was like, man I&#039;m doing a lot of research on this niche, or I&#039;m doing a lot of hard work here. I&#039;m reading a lot of books, I&#039;m taking a lot of action, but I&#039;m not seeing a whole bunch of results. A few years later, boom, all of a sudden, oh my god, where is all of this money coming from. I even wondered, I was like, &quot;Where is this all coming from? How did this just come out of the blue?&quot; That&#039;s when I really realized that I was starting to collect compound interest on all of the things I had done over the past five years and my growth curve started to look like this.

I lost money in my first year, I made $100,000 in my second, or my first year of having my consulting business, I did $100,000, then I did $500,000, then I did 1.2, then I did 2.4, then I went up to 18.25. This year I will do over 50 million and next year I&#039;m sure I will do over 100 million. You might wonder, &quot;Well how the hell does that happen? How does someone go from being broke to that?&quot; Well, it starts to curve like this. I&#039;m telling you, the money I make right now, it isn&#039;t from the work I did this year, it&#039;s a compounding effect from the work I did from the very beginning.

This is how cause and effect works. It&#039;s like we take an action now and we do get some effect from the actions which we take now. The effect curves, it goes exponentially. Truthfully, when I&#039;m 60, 70, 80 years old, I&#039;m still going to be collecting dividends on those actions which I took when I was younger and I wondered if it was ever going to be worth it. When I read that book, was it ever going to be worth it? This is how it works. It curves up like this.

Here is the other force against it which is our memory. A lot of people don&#039;t think about it like this but this is how human memory looks. If you look at any sort of scientific research, this is how memory looks in terms of it&#039;s accuracy. Our memory is really good right now. If we take an action today, then we&#039;re pretty good at remembering what we did today. As time goes by, our memory fades away and our memory gets worse and worse and worse. It curves exponentially like this until we literally get to a point in time where it&#039;s very hard to even remember what happened at all?

Here&#039;s a good question. Two Wednesdays ago, what did you eat for lunch? Without looking at anything, what did you eat for lunch? Just think about that. If you&#039;re most people, 99% of people couldn&#039;t figure that one out, I can&#039;t figure that one out, I don&#039;t remember. What about two months ago, minus two days off that, what did you have for breakfast? Without looking, what did you have? You don&#039;t know, you can&#039;t remember. What did you do on August 13th when you were three years old? It&#039;s blank, we don&#039;t know.

This is what I&#039;m talking about. Most humans, they think that their memory is some awesome thing that doesn&#039;t get anything wrong, but really it is so so inaccurate. It can&#039;t remember things. It can&#039;t remember very much at all. Our memory curves like this. What&#039;s really interesting, this really just hit me one day and I figured it out, I was like, &quot;Oh my god, this is why humans are so fallible with everything.&quot; It&#039;s because these two curves work like this. Cause and effect is the governing thing that the world works by. People don&#039;t just get rich by chance and people don&#039;t just get fit and healthy by chance. People don&#039;t just win marathons by chance. People don&#039;t just live happy lives by chance.

Society is made out that if you&#039;re rich, you&#039;re just lucky and it&#039;s pretty much a miracle or impossible to become rich, become wealthy and live how you want. Well, it&#039;s not, it&#039;s cause and effect. Here&#039;s how we keep forgetting that it is cause and effect. It&#039;s because these two exponential curves work on opposites to each other. If I take an action right now today and I don&#039;t see very much reward for that action, if I spend a day working on my business and I don&#039;t see much reward for that, I&#039;ve got a very good memory collection of that. I&#039;m like, &quot;I did a lot of work today and I didn&#039;t get much result today.&quot; Over time, that work I did starts to get more and more result.

In say, one year from now, I get this result. I get a phone call from this guy who I spoke to a year ago and he&#039;s like, &quot;Oh hey, you remember how we talked about your ideas for my business? I thought about it and I want to sign up with you,&quot; and the guy signs up with you. You&#039;re like, &quot;Man, that just came out of the blue, where did that came from?&quot; That&#039;s because you forgot what you did one year ago. One year ago, you might have spent that one day working on your business then gave up. Now you&#039;re like, &quot;Oh, that was a fluke, I wonder why more things like that don&#039;t happen.&quot; That&#039;s because someone gave up and they can&#039;t remember what cause caused that effect.

Quite often by the time we get exponential effect from an action, we&#039;ve forgotten what action we actually took that caused it. This is what makes human beings so fallible. I&#039;ll try to make this a bit clearer for you. An action taken here at this moment in time has little effect and strong memory to witness it and build belief systems. However, that same action has an exponential effect at this latter point in time, with little to no memory to remember what caused it.

If we save a dollar a day now, at the time when we can remember it, we&#039;re like, &quot;This is useless, this sucks because I&#039;m not getting any money, I&#039;m not rich, I don&#039;t see Ferrari&#039;s and I&#039;m only just saving a dollar a day.&quot; That&#039;s what our memory says to us, but if we were to stick to it over a long number of years, then we&#039;re like, &quot;Whoa, where did all of these millions of dollars come from?&quot; Well, you can&#039;t remember back to when you were taking those actions that caused that effect.

I&#039;m really trying to make everyone understand this. An action taken here has little effect at this moment in time and strong memory to witness it and build belief systems. This same action has an exponential effect at this later point in time with little to no memory to remember what caused it. Simply put, by the time a memory has faded, only remembering small effect, effect grows exponentially with little to no memory of what cause created it.

Here&#039;s why most people fail. This is why most humans aren&#039;t successful. They think it&#039;s because of something else, this is it. People start a journey and they can&#039;t see effect from cause immediately, so they give up and quit before they reach the point where effect starts compounding. Someone wants to start their own business, or something picks a niche and they start researching into the niche and they&#039;re like, &quot;I&#039;m not seeing any money, I&#039;m not seeing any customers or massive rewards. This niche must suck,&quot; so they chuck it out and they choose a new niche. Someone might start and think, &quot;Oh, this business idea it doesn&#039;t work, I&#039;m going to throw it out.&quot; Someone might start with Facebook ads, &quot;Oh Facebook ads don&#039;t work, throw it out.&quot; What happens with these people is they keep looking for effect in the short term and they never stick to it long enough where effect starts compounding.

Number two, people who stick at it long enough to experience compounding effect often forget what cause was responsible for creating it. This makes things appear chaotic and out of their control. The second reason why people fail is they stick to something, they stick to something for long enough, but then they start seeing the compounding effect. They forgot what actually caused it, so they go and change things and they change things that weren&#039;t broken. I can&#039;t tell you how many times I&#039;ve seen successful business people stop doing the things that made them successful and completely forgotten about them, then they wonder why their business isn&#039;t successful anymore.

This is the dangerous thing which we have as humans. Cause and effect is distanced over time and it has an exponential curve looking that way. However, our memory fades and it has an exponential curve looking the other way. It means that an action we take now, we won&#039;t see the full effect of it until years in the future, however our memory isn&#039;t going to remember what cause we took that made that effect happen in the future.

This is the massive thing that human beings haven&#039;t been able to grapple with and they haven&#039;t been able to get their head around. If you wonder why I have so much money now and why I&#039;ve been so successful now, and how I completely took over the entire consulting industry, it&#039;s because I stuck to it. The fruits which I&#039;m seeing now are the compounding effects of all the hard work I did over those years.

I only saw 100,000 in year one. In my first year of starting I really didn&#039;t see anything. When I started consulting I only got 100,000, then my second year I was only 500,000, then my third, and it started curving up. I didn&#039;t start collecting massive payoffs until I had stuck to one thing. I stuck to my niche, my consulting. I stuck at it, I didn&#039;t give up. Most people don&#039;t stick to things. Most people don&#039;t even stick to business, full stop. Most people try one business idea, it doesn&#039;t work, so they give up completely and they&#039;re like, &quot;I know, business doesn&#039;t work.&quot;

First thing is, you&#039;ve got to stick to business. The second thing is, you have to stick to a niche. If you keep checking out your niche and you do what I call, niche jumping, and you keep grabbing a new niche, then a new niche, then a new niche and you&#039;re like, &quot;I know, this niche doesn&#039;t work, this niche doesn&#039;t work, this niche doesn&#039;t work.&quot; You&#039;re just keeping on going through this model which I&#039;ve got on the screen. You&#039;re not sticking to a niche long enough to get exponential effect.

I stuck at consulting and I doubted it, but I doubted it every day. I thought, &quot;Oh, this other niche looks good, or this eCommerce niche looks good, maybe I should start this business doing this, maybe I should start my business doing that.&quot; I even did start a couple of other businesses. I ended up slowing down my progress, then realizing, oh my god, what an idiot I was. Getting rid of that business completely, then coming back to consulting. Most people, they keep forgetting. Their memories are bad and they forget what got them their success and they don&#039;t stick at things long enough to start seeing the compounding effect.

Society has made business out to be this massive gamble of the 1% who are lucky. Society says that the people who make a lot of money, they&#039;re lucky, it&#039;s all a fluke. Most people would think that my luck is a fluke. Most people would think that my luck is because I&#039;m privilege or something, like I was just given a whole bunch of money by family or somebody just gave me a whole bunch of stuff. That&#039;s not true at all.  People who are successful, it&#039;s not due to luck. I don&#039;t believe in luck, I don&#039;t believe that is such a thing as luck. I&#039;m here today to tell you that there is no such thing as luck and I truly believe this. I don&#039;t think there is anything called luck or chance, only natural law from cause and effect compounded exponentially over time.

Most people might be able to get their head around cause and effect. I eat pies and I lie on the couch, then I&#039;m probably not going to be very healthy and I&#039;m not going to look the best. What they don&#039;t understand is, even if someone does understand cause and effect like that, they don&#039;t understand the exponentially compounding effect of time. If you eat one pie today, you don&#039;t know what effect that&#039;s going to have on you in ten years, five years. See, we tend to look at things only today. We&#039;re like, &quot;Oh if I eat this pie today, I won&#039;t look that much different today.&quot; How do we know what that one decision to eat that pie, how do we know what that&#039;s going to cause for us in five years? You don&#039;t want to mess with things like this.

Time compounds everything exponentially. The one decision I made to quit my job at Vodafone, that one tiny decision, when I made that decision and I quit, I doubted myself, I was like, &quot;Well maybe that was the wrong decision. I&#039;m not feeling too good,&quot; so my memory is starting to be like, &quot;Okay, quit job, and what I can remember is I think I made the wrong decision.&quot; There&#039;s my memory, it&#039;s going and doing it&#039;s analysis on things right now. It made me kind of feel like I had made the wrong decision. That one decision I made at that point in time, if we were to look at it&#039;s effect, if that was the cause and today we were to look at the effect, it&#039;s more than $20,000,000. That&#039;s massive. If we look at that point in time, I was worried. That&#039;s how things work.

Everything in this life is cause and effect and it&#039;s compounded exponentially over time. When you&#039;re taking action every day, when you choose to put an hour into your business today, when you choose to write down your goals today, or when you choose to do this training today, or when you choose to make a call to a prospect today, when you choose to do any action today, you have to think it&#039;s effect in the long term. If you just make one small little move today, I can&#039;t tell you how life changing, the effect of it in your future is bigger than you can possibly imagine.

If people just choose to watch Game of Thrones today, or just go out and party today, you don&#039;t know what sort of effect that&#039;s having on you in five years from now. As the human race, we&#039;ve pretty much been brought up to forget about the future. Everyone is like, &quot;Just live in the now and forget about the future.&quot; I agree, we should live in the now, but we shouldn&#039;t forget about what we&#039;re doing to our future. You want to be putting in deposits into this future bank account all the time. This is what you&#039;re doing working on your mindset, working on yourself and working on your business. Honestly, you will not see massive results in the short term. You&#039;re going to see results, believe me, this course shows you how to get clients, how to start a business and how to make money and everything. You will see those results, but don&#039;t expect massive things to happen on the very first day. Things compound over time. The biggest thing that is effecting all entrepreneurs is time and they forget that.

Albert Einstein said this, &quot;Compound interest is the 8th wonder of the world. He who understands it, earns it. He who doesn&#039;t pays it.&quot; At first I was like, &quot;This doesn&#039;t make much sense. Compound interest, everyone knows about compound interest.&quot; I read about this years ago, then it really struck me and it dawned on me. He was talking about everything. Time on everything in this world has interest on it. The way time works, when I actually understood how time works, most people don&#039;t understand how it works. I won&#039;t get into it in this because it would take me a day to describe it to you, but time has compounding effects on it. Whatever you do today, it starts to exponentially compound on itself. The same way compound interest does in a bank account.

If you save a dollar today and that&#039;s all you do, at first you&#039;re going to be like, &quot;Well I&#039;ve hardly got any money, I&#039;m only saving a dollar a day,&quot; but if you were to use a compound interest calculator and you were to work that out over time, oh my god, it would blow your mind. If you were to look at Warren Buffet&#039;s wealth over time, I&#039;m actually going to look this one up just so I can really drive this point home. I&#039;m just pulling this up right now, I want a screenshot of Warren Buffet&#039;s net worth over time. Look at this.

Why does Warren Buffet&#039;s wealth look like this? A lot of people, they look at Warren Buffet and they look at how much money he&#039;s got, like 62 billion or however much it is and they&#039;re like, &quot;I wonder how he got that?&quot; You look at it across time. You look at every wealthy person&#039;s money across time and it looks like this. Most entrepreneurs have forgotten, or maybe what they&#039;ve never learned. I think what most people in the world have never learned is the effect that time has one everything. Not just on money, but on every single cause and effect relationship in the world. This is what what Albert Einstein was getting at. He said, &quot;Compound interest is the 8th wonder of the world, he who understands it earns it, he who doesn&#039;t pays it.&quot; Those who forget about compound interest end up paying for it dearly. I don&#039;t just mean money wise, I mean everything wise.

Here&#039;s how this applies to you. Here&#039;s how to master natural law. I&#039;ve told you how it works, but here&#039;s how to master it. Knowledge, knowledge is literally power and understanding oneself in the governing laws of nature should be the highest priority in order to live a happy and purposeful life.

Here&#039;s what you must promise to me, to yourself and to everyone else right now. Number one is you must promise to become a keen learner with a passion for acquiring worldly wisdom. You have got to open up your mind and you&#039;ve got to decide that you&#039;re going to learn some things. You have to have a passion for acquiring wisdom. If you don&#039;t know how the world works and you don&#039;t know how things work, then you&#039;re always going to suffer as a victim. Make this promise right now.

Second promise, memory. Beliefs and stories about the past are extremely inaccurate and are the root cause of most people&#039;s issues and limitations. Undoing the knots and reprogramming your brain is of extreme importance. Here&#039;s what you must promise. You must promise to work on confronting the belief systems and installing a new paradigm and world view.

The way that you see things right now is not accurate because people with belief systems that have been worked on and people with accurate paradigms and world views, they make a lot of money and they live exactly how they want to live. They don&#039;t see life as a pinball machine of chance. They see life as what they make of it. Someone who doesn&#039;t see life like that is going to have a faulty paradigm and a faulty world view. You must promise to work on confronting belief systems and installing a new paradigm and world view.

The third one, time. Understanding the non-linear compounding effects of time and how to use it to your ultimate advantage is essential to making large sums of money. You must promise to stick to this process and take consistent action until compounding joins your side. Remember Albert Einstein said, &quot;The 8th wonder of the world is compound interest.&quot; Well, if it&#039;s so powerful, if it&#039;s literally as powerful as the 8th wonder of the world, you definitely want to have it on your side. You want to have all of these forces on your side. Compound interest is one of the greatest forces there is. In order to get it on your side, you need to stick to something. Not just stick to business, but stick to mindset. The mindset work I&#039;m going to get you to do, stick to it. If I tell you to do mindset stuff every day, do it every day, don&#039;t just stop doing it after four days. You&#039;re not going to see that exponential effect.

If I tell you to read your goals each day and you write down that you want a Ferrari in your goals and you don&#039;t see a Ferrari on day four, well don&#039;t stop, just understand that curve. Believe me, I wrote down that I wanted a Ferrari on my goals and I thought that I was really pushing it. I forgot how old I was when I did this. I think I was 22 years old. I wrote down that I wanted a red Ferrari and I thought, &quot;Sam, you&#039;re being an idiot,&quot; but I was like, &quot;I may as well try it right? I might as well write it down and see if it happens.&quot; I still thought, &quot;Man, you&#039;re being an idiot.&quot;

I kept it on my goals, I read the thing every day and I didn&#039;t give up on it. What&#039;s crazy is that, I think at some point through that year I must have given up on reading the goals. What happened is I found it on my computer and I read through it, I was like, &quot;Oh my god,&quot; because I had that Ferrari. I was like, &quot;Well, these things are powerful.&quot; I had forgotten quite a lot, quite often we achieve our goals at a time when we forgot that they were actually even our goals. This is what&#039;s dangerous and this is what makes people stop reading goals, stop setting goals and they stop believing in cause and effect and they start believing in chance. It&#039;s memory that makes you do that.

Sometimes we can believe in cause and effect and we&#039;ve got it, then we forget about it. Now we think it&#039;s just up to change again. It&#039;s so important that we understand how fallible we are, knowledge, memory and time. We forget about all of these things. We forget that every action we take today is going to have an exponential effect in the future. We forget that the way we remember things is wrong and that sometimes we can&#039;t even remember anything. We forget that we are always learning and the only way to really lose is to think that you don&#039;t need to learn anything else.

You must promise to stick to all three of these things if you want to master natural law and be in control of your own life. The eyes are useless when the mind is blind. Your current understanding and knowledge got you here, but it will not take you where you want to go. Throughout this journey, you must keep an open mind. I&#039;ve just shown you some things about time, cause and effect, natural law, and I can tell you that a closed mind will tell you this stuff is useless, this stuff is too basic. Where&#039;s the Facebook ads? That is what a closed mind would say. An open mind would say, &quot;Wow, I never thought about time like that. I can now see the point.&quot; You must keep an open mind.

Now let&#039;s talk about the consulting equation. I showed you the governing equation of all evolution of human species and, well, everything in nature. Here is the consulting equation. This is how we go about creating value in the marketplace is a consultant. If you&#039;re new and you don&#039;t have a niche, if you have never started a consulting business before and you&#039;re like, &quot;What am I going to do? How am I going to make any money? I don&#039;t know anything. I don&#039;t know any problems to solve. I don&#039;t even have a niche.&quot; I&#039;m going to show you how it works. I&#039;m going to show you how it&#039;s really quite simple.

What is the consulting equation? It looks like this, just like we had our law of nature which was the thesis, antithesis and synthesis. We have niche offer and result. We choose a niche and then we look at the niche and we&#039;re like, &quot;What is the problems of this niche?&quot; What are your problems, then what are your desired situations? Then we try an offer. We try selling them something and doing some services for them, or teaching them some things. The niche comes into contact with this offer, then there is an end result. That really is how simple it is. It&#039;s a niche, an offer and a result. The niche collides with the offer, then comes about a result.

It can also be reduced into an equation like this Niche x Offer = Result. Let&#039;s go through each one of these. Niche is a specific group of people who cluster together with similar attributes. These users can be clustered in any way, shape or form. It can be b2b, b2c, or what I call b2p, because really there&#039;s no such thing as b2b or b2c, it&#039;s just business to people. The main thing is that it&#039;s specific and participants have similarities. We&#039;re looking for a grouping of people together. We must start with a group. We don&#039;t want to start with everyone because everyone is different. If we focus on everyone, then our offer is going to work for some people and it&#039;s not going to work for some people, and we&#039;re going to wonder where we went wrong. Where we went wrong is we focused on everyone instead of on a group.

You must choose a niche which is a group of people. We want to make sure that they&#039;re similar and we must identify a painful problem that they want to solve. What&#039;s a problem that they have, then we must identify a powerful desire for a solution or transformation they have. What is their current situation and what is their desired situation?

Then we have our offer. An offer is the promised solution, service, information or advice that you provide. It should be designed to solve the problem and achieve the desire of the niche. When you create an offer, you don&#039;t just make some stuff up, you don&#039;t just throw some stuff in a bag. You look at your niche and you look at where their current situation is, then you look at where their desired situation is. You didn&#039;t make those up, you actually went to the niche and asked them. Now you&#039;ve designed an offer that is designed to help someone get from their current situation to their desired situation. It should be designed to solve the problem and achieve the desired result of the niche. It should be minimal in terms of your time and should be repeatable as possible.

Most people design an offer and they&#039;re like, well we&#039;ve thrown some stuff in the bag. Let&#039;s throw as much stuff in this bag as possible so people feel like they&#039;ve really got a lot. That&#039;s madness. The world has gone mad. You&#039;re not throwing some stuff in a bag when you have an offer. You&#039;re looking at what the market needs and you&#039;re only putting the one little thing in that bag that actually achieves the result. You&#039;re thinking in terms of as minimal as possible. You want to offer the smallest thing as possible and it should use as little of your time as possible and it should be as repeatable as possible. That&#039;s the offer.

Then the two collide. The niche and the offer. Here, the way to think about it is literally just like a chemical reaction. Imagine if we had the niche, the current situation and the desired situation, then we put it into contact in a test tube with an offer that we&#039;ve designed. Now the two are in contact with each other, they&#039;re reacting. There&#039;s going to be some change. The person is told to do this thing, the person is told to do that thing, then the person tries doing that thing and they try doing that thing. Now things are changing, change is taking place, things are shaking up and there&#039;s a reaction. After the reaction comes the result.

The result is the end situation/state after the niche collides with the offer. After the collision has happened and things are shaken up, what is the result? The result should be the solution to the niche&#039;s problem and the desires. Remember in the beginning when we picked the niche and we found out what the current situation was and the desired situation, well if our offer was right, then the result should have been the person solving their problem and the person achieving their desires. If it wasn&#039;t right, then they didn&#039;t achieve those things. If it was kind of right, then they might have gotten half way.

This is how we understand if we get something right or wrong here. The end result should be what desires at the start were and nothing else. The result should be as profound as possible in the least amount of time possible. We&#039;re looking for results that are profound. We don&#039;t just want to help someone make a small little increase. Let&#039;s say we chose the niche dentists and I did not choose this niche for any reason, so don&#039;t think, &quot;Oh Sam used dentists, so I&#039;m going to use dentists.&quot; I didn&#039;t, I chose it at random.

Let&#039;s say I chose dentists and I talk to them and what&#039;s their desired situation? Well, I wish I could make an extra $10,000 a month with my company. If I went out and I designed an offer to help them do that, then we apply the offer to the niche and the current situation and the end result is they&#039;re able to make an extra $5,000, well that&#039;s not very awesome because it&#039;s only half of what someone wanted. Eventually that person is going to cancel that service, if not, they might cancel it right away.

A profound result is something that exceeds someone&#039;s expectations. Let&#039;s say we chose dentists, they want an extra $10,000 a month, let&#039;s say they did it. They hired us and they ended up making $100,000 a month, that&#039;s profound. When you have a service or when you have a consulting offer that literally has an effect and result like that, that&#039;s how you make a lot of money. That&#039;s how things go viral, that&#039;s when every dentist in the world starts telling every other dentist about this thing. That&#039;s when things go boom. That&#039;s exponential.

As a consultant, this is all we&#039;re doing. We&#039;re looking at these three things, niche, offer, result. We&#039;re constantly working on these things. We&#039;re thinking, we&#039;re talking to our niche, we&#039;re like, &quot;What&#039;s your current situation? What&#039;s your desired situation?&quot; We&#039;re keeping our fingers on the pulse on the niche, the near needs, the near wants and near desires, then we&#039;re looking at our offer. We&#039;re like, &quot;How could our offer be better? Could we take this thing out of our offer? Could we do more of this? Could we do less to that? Maybe we should try doing this?&quot; Improving that offer, then looking at the results.

What results are these people getting? Are the results fading down or are they getting worse, or are our results getting better? This one client we had, they got a massive result, but how come these other clients we have didn&#039;t get much of a result at all? What did they do different? As a consultant, you&#039;re just playing with this constantly, you&#039;re thinking niche, offer, result and you&#039;re trying to make it as profound as possible. Not only as profound as possible but in the least amount of time possible.

This is what people want, they want as much as they can get in the shortest amount of time. That&#039;s what every human being wants. If you ask them what they want, they want everything and they want it now and they&#039;re allowed to want that. The more that you can give them in the shortest amount of time, that&#039;s how you create an amazing offer. When you&#039;re designing, when you&#039;re working through this and you&#039;re thinking niche, offer, result, you want to be thinking how profound is the result and how quick am I able to deliver it? If you can deliver a profound result in a short amount of time, you&#039;re going to make a lot of money. It doesn&#039;t have to start profound. I don&#039;t think anyone&#039;s offer or anyone&#039;s result starts being profound.

When I started out as a consultant, I started out just helping people with websites and stuff. I can tell you that the results people got, they were not profound. The amount of time it took was a long time, but over the course of years and over the course of me really focusing on this and thinking about it, I was able to get the results more and more profound, and the timeframes, I was able to tighten and squeeze into a shorter and shorter amount of time. That&#039;s how I started getting clients like Andrew Agnew who went from $17,000 a month to $200,000 a month in 90 days. That&#039;s obscene, that is a profound result.  I&#039;ve had tons of other people like that. I&#039;ve taken a lot of people to more than a million dollars within one year. That&#039;s profound. That&#039;s what you want to do. You want to always be looking at that. How can I squeeze the timeframes, how can I make the result more profound?

Let&#039;s look at some example to really cement this. This might seem way too simple to some people, but I can guarantee you the people whose minds are closed off to this are the people that are going to have non-stop issues with this, so you must keep an open mind. Here&#039;s an example, niche, a small one to five person account firm. That could be the niche, now we ask them what their problem is, it&#039;s struggling to get clients. Their desire, they want to make more money than what they could at a big firm.

This is quite true with a lot of accountants. They&#039;re always comparing the income to what they could make if they went and got a job at like Deloitte, EY or one of those. They&#039;re always comparing it to that, so their desire is to make more than what they could at a big firm. They&#039;re struggling to get client in a small one to five accounting firm. We want to also grade the urgency, how bad do these people want it? How bad is their problem and how urgent is their desire? The higher we get out of 10 on this one, it means we&#039;ve found a good niche and a good problem within that niche. We&#039;ve got a way to grade the niche and the niche&#039;s problem and desire, so we give this a rating out of 10. I&#039;m going to say this one is 6 out of 10.

Now we&#039;re got our offer. We could come up with a message and it would be, &quot;We will build your funnel, Facebook ads and get you clients in 30 days.&quot; I might have done my research, I might have come up with some different things and figured out I could help accountants with Facebook ads in a funnel and I could help them get clients in 30 days.

Now the model, how are we delivering this to them? I&#039;m going to teach you about messages, models and all of this stuff very soon, so don&#039;t worry if you don&#039;t understand this right now. This is just an example. The model might be done for you, which means we will do the work for them.

Now the economics, how is our business model working? What&#039;s our price like? We say, $2,000 a month. Then resonance, this is a way of grading our offer. How well does the market receive our offer? When we make our offer to someone, which is the combination of our message and what we&#039;re doing, how potent is it? How much of an effect does it have on accountants when they hear that? Is it something that they just brush off and they&#039;re like, &quot;Oh, I&#039;ve heard it, this sounds useless,&quot; or is it something that makes them kind of sit up in their chair and they&#039;re like, &quot;Well this sounds awesome.&quot; That&#039;s what we call resonance and we grade this out of 10. The better your offer is and the better your message is, the higher this resonance score gets. We might say this is resonance 7 out of 10.

Then the result. The desired result is getting more clients and making more money they could at a big firm. The complexity, the possibility and the timeframe. This is how we grade our results. In order to get the desired result, how complex is it? We&#039;re doing Done For You, building funnels and doing Facebook ads, complexity is pretty high. It&#039;s like a 9 out of 10. How possible is it? If I&#039;m being truly honest with myself, how possible do I think it is to get accountants more money than they could at a big firm with my offer? Well I&#039;m going to give it a ranking for possibility, then the timeframe, how quick can I deliver it by? Well, it&#039;s going to take me about 40 days.

We come up with these. The desired result, the complexity, possibility and timeframe. This is basically how we do it. We look for a niche, then we look for a problem and a desire, then we grade the urgency. How bad do these people want it? This is the first step, we have to have a niche. We can&#039;t start a consulting business without having a niche, it&#039;s impossible. We have to identify a problem and a desire. We don&#039;t know what to get them if we don&#039;t know what they want. If someone just walks into an airport, we need to know what they want, we need to know where they want to go before we try to sell them something. Otherwise if we walk up to them and just try to sell them a ticket to China, Africa or whatever, they might not be interested at all because it&#039;s not where they want to go.

This is what a lot of consultants do. A lot of consultants are out there selling people tickets to China when they want to go to France. If you&#039;ve got an offer that&#039;s telling someone to go to China when everyone wants to go to France, it&#039;s going to be damn hard to sell. You&#039;re not going to be able to sell it to anyone. This is literally what most people have.

You need to find out what the niche is, then you need to find out what their problem and desire is, then you need to rank on a scale of 1 to 10, how much urgency is there? How much desire is there behind this niche wanting it? Is this niche extremely hungry for this? Are they just chomping at the bit for this, or do they just barely even want it? You have to give it a grade.

Then the offer. What is the message? What are we doing for them, then what model are we using? Are we using Done For You, are we using invite 101 coaching, what is it? What are the economics? How much are we charging? Is it recurring revenue or is it one off? What is the resonance of this offer? Is this a really really on point sexy offer that just makes people sit up in their chair, or is this just an offer where people are like, &quot;Meh, I&#039;ve heard that before.&quot; Give it a grade, something out of 10, 1 to 10.

Then result. How complex is it for you to deliver? How possible is it for you to deliver and how fast can you deliver it and what is the result? This is the consulting equation and the difference between a good consultant and a bad consultant. The clearer you are on this formula and the higher you are on these different grading scales, the better your consulting business is going to be.

If you want to know why my consulting business makes more than $100,000 a day and is on track to make $50,000,000 this year. A lot of people may think, &quot;Oh because Sam has a New Zealand accent. He&#039;s got a nice apartment and people see the New York view and just give him money.&quot; People might think, &quot;Oh it&#039;s because he does something with Facebook ads. It&#039;s because he has this one thing on his landing page or something.&quot; People are crazy. It&#039;s not because of any of those things.

People go and focus on the wrong things. People think it&#039;s all about Facebook ads, people think it&#039;s all about what someone&#039;s wearing in a video. Oh it&#039;s because he wears a suit, oh it&#039;s because his hair is long, it&#039;s because his hair is short, it&#039;s because of his accent. People are mad. It&#039;s not because of any of those things at all. It&#039;s purely because I absolutely nailed this thing. I made sure that I understood my niche better than anyone else. I made sure that I understood their problems and desires better than anyone else. I could accurately write a day in my niche&#039;s diary better than they could themselves. I could write a day in their diary, they could find it and they would think, &quot;Oh my god this person knows more about me than I do,&quot; and I know more about their desires than they do.

I know that I have really picked the best thing here. On an urgency, I&#039;m like on a 9 out of 10, 10 out of 10, so I&#039;ve really got that dialed in on the niche side. On the offer side, I&#039;ve got this offer dialed in. I&#039;ve got the message razor sharp. I&#039;ve got the model totally optimized. I&#039;ve got the economics dialed in and the resonance of my message, it makes hairs stand up on people&#039;s arms. That didn&#039;t happen by chance, it happens over time and by constantly thinking about this.

Then the result, my stuff gets results. If people bought my programs, my training and people hired me as a consultant and they didn&#039;t get results, I wouldn&#039;t last very long. Results are the most important thing. My people get results. They take my programs, they get results, we have stories of people getting profound results in a short amount of time. We do get profound results, we do get them in a short amount of time. The possibility is very high because a lot of people get results. The complexity is pretty low because I don&#039;t have to do a huge amount of work. Quite often I don&#039;t even need to talk to someone and they can just go through my programs and end up with profound results in a short amount of time.

That&#039;s the science behind successful consulting. That&#039;s the science behind a business that makes a lot of money. It&#039;s not what everyone thinks. It&#039;s not because of some doing YouTube ads and someone doing Facebook ads. It&#039;s not because of someone&#039;s accent, their haircut, the fact that someone wears green sunglasses instead of black. People have gone mad. They think it&#039;s all of these other things and it&#039;s just this. If you get all of this stuff right, it doesn&#039;t matter what you do.

If you look at my Facebook, I&#039;m horrible at social media. I don&#039;t have an Instagram account, it just has nothing on it. I don&#039;t blog, I haven&#039;t done a blog post in more than a year. My branding is pretty bad. If you look at my website, it looks pretty bad. I pretty much do everything wrong. I haven&#039;t written a book, I haven&#039;t been in New York Times Bestseller, I don&#039;t speak on stages, I don&#039;t do anything. I don&#039;t do any of stuff which everyone thinks you should be doing.

In the modern world, we&#039;ve gotten it confused. I read an awesome article on this the other day. It said American actors are starting to fade and European actors are starting to poach bigger roles off of them. I forget who said it, I think it was Dustin Hoffman who wrote this article. He said, &quot;What&#039;s happening is American actors are starting to care more about their image and social media appearances than they do about their craft.&quot; Actors are starting to put more effort and attention into their Facebook, their Instagram and Snapchat than they are to putting practice into a good actor.

What&#039;s happening is, over time, other people who are focused on the right thing are getting better at being an actor, then they get overtaken all of a sudden. You&#039;ll notice that the best actors in the world, they have really bad social media accounts. Go look at Leonardo DiCaprio as one. The dude is out of the spotlight. The dude is mysterious. You don&#039;t hear about him much, he&#039;s out of the radar. How does he win? He&#039;s just the best damn actor there is right now. The best basketball players like Michael Jordan, they&#039;re not out there doing the things that don&#039;t matter, they just do the thing that matters and they let that speak for them. They&#039;re just the best and they let the rumors spread everything.

We&#039;ve gotten confused. A lot of people think it&#039;s the wrong things. People are trying to be famous without having an substance. That&#039;s madness. I don&#039;t care at all about being famous. In fact, I would like to be as least famous as possible, but I care about substance. I care about my work and methods. I care about them being the best in the world. I want that to be the best in the world, then my social media image, I don&#039;t care. I prefer for it to be the worst in the world.

We&#039;ve gone and gotten confused. If you ever wondered what makes a company so successful, what makes a consultant so successful. How am I going to make million in my business? It&#039;s about mastering this. This is the core of everything. This is the cause and effect. This is the equation, your niche, understanding it, how urgent is it? Your message, your model, your economics, the resonance of your message with your market, then your result. How profound is it? Can you deliver on it? How complex is it for you to deliver? How possible is it for you to deliver? What sort of timeframe can you deliver it in? This is what it all is.

If you get this stuff right, you don&#039;t even need Facebook ads. People will just be lined up outside your door, knocking on the door, ready to buy. If you don&#039;t believe me, let&#039;s take this to the extreme all right? Niche, offer, result. Let&#039;s say we&#039;re a big need in the world right now. Would probably be like a cure for cancer. Niche would be people who have cancer. Their desire is damn high, that&#039;s like 10 out of 10. That&#039;s the niche and the urgency is 10 out of 10. Offer, we have a pill you can take, one single pill and it removes cancer. Okay, that has 10 out of 10 resonance and you could charge any amount of money for that pill. You could charge $10,000 for it and people are going to find $10,000 for that pill. The model is just giving people a pill and the message is just simple, it&#039;s just cure cancer with one pill.

Then the result. Cancer cured. Complexity is pretty much 1 out of 10 because they just swallow a pill. Possibility is 10 out of 10 because it happens every time. Timeframe is over night. That&#039;s an extreme example. I&#039;m using an extreme example just to give you an idea. If you could come up with that, believe me, you don&#039;t need to know how to do Facebook ads, you don&#039;t know how to do anything. You could have the worst website in the world. You could literally create a website that just says, please don&#039;t buy from me, just one sentence on the page. You could have no social media presence, nothing and you just don&#039;t need anything and you&#039;re going to be the richest person in the world.

That&#039;s what it&#039;s all about. It&#039;s about getting these things right. It&#039;s about getting the foundations right, then using Facebook and stuff to spread the word. When we go to Facebook and we go to spread the word, we want to make sure that the word we&#039;re spreading is good. Most people go to Facebook, try it, and their message is so lame, they&#039;re not really solving any problem that Facebook doesn&#039;t work, then they think Facebook doesn&#039;t work. They don&#039;t think it&#039;s their fault, they think, &quot;Oh Facebook ads, they don&#039;t work.&quot; No, no, no, it&#039;s your niche, your offer and your result. That&#039;s what sucks.

Most consulting business I look at, this is what&#039;s all messed up. Most businesses I look at, this is what&#039;s messed up. It&#039;s never a fact of Facebook messing up, it&#039;s never a fact of any of these other things, it&#039;s always this. I know I&#039;ve gone on this for a long time, but this is so so important, I cannot drum it in anymore. This is it, you want to make sure you get the stuff right and you want to make sure you&#039;re non-stop constantly trying to improve on this.

It doesn&#039;t have to be business either. It&#039;s not always about making money. I know that in what I teach, is a lot of how to make money and a lot of my students, they&#039;re about how to improve revenues too. Trust me, you don&#039;t need to be selling something which is about money. I&#039;ll give you an example. One of my students Brittany, she&#039;s in a personal niche. Her niche is binge eating. Brittany, her niche is young women who struggle with binge eating issues. Their problem is their struggling with binge eating, health and well being. The desire is to be free from this destructive habit.

The urgency is pretty high on this one, I&#039;d say it&#039;s 9 out of 10. She&#039;s got a good niche, it&#039;s unique and they do have a real problem, they do have a real desire and this is serious to them. This is high on their priority list and it&#039;s 9 out of 10. Offer, so the message is to beat binge eating in 60 days or less. Her model is an online group coaching program, so she has an online program that she helps people with and her website is beatingbingeeating.com, you can even go and have a look at it and everything. Economics is $4,000, one time fee. Resonance. Now the resonance of this message is pretty strong. Beat binge eating in 60 days or less. Okay, this is pretty powerful for the right person who hears this, so probably give her a 9 out of 10 on resonance.

The result, the desired result. We&#039;re free from binge eating and have it in 60 days. The complexity of delivering this, it&#039;s not very complex. Some online group coaching, of 4 out of 10, possibility 8 out of 10, pretty good success rate with it. Timeframe, 40 days. She can deliver it better than what she is saying. Okay, this is pretty good, now this is a good offer. This is a good consulting business. Brittany has a unique niche that&#039;s specific, they have a problem, they have a desire, it&#039;s got a high urgency, she&#039;s got a good message, a good model, strong economics and the resonance rating is high. The result is she can achieve the result, it&#039;s not very complex to deliver and the timeframe in which she can deliver it by is pretty quick.

This adds up to a good consulting business. That&#039;s why Brittany has been able to do extremely well. When she started working with me, I think she was making like two or three grand a month, hardly anything. She was run wild all over the place. She was offering like 50 different things, doing one on one coaching and all sorts. She was making like two or three grand a month. Last time I checked which was a few months ago, I think she&#039;s up to $60,000 or $70,000 a month, so she&#039;s pretty close to $1,000,000 a year. I&#039;d say she would definitely go more than $1,000,000 a year this year. She&#039;s not teaching people how to make money. Look here at her result, it&#039;s not about how to make any money. It&#039;s just how to be free from a binge eating habit in 60 days or less.

When you&#039;re coming up with your niche and everything, don&#039;t think that it has to be about money. There are a lot of things that people care about more than money. Believe me, if someone had a binge eating issue, they would rather fix that than just learn how to make an extra 3000 bucks. A lot of people in the relationship niche, the health and fitness niche, the pain relief niche and all sorts of niches, people care about things more than they care about money. Don&#039;t feel like you have to do something which is to do with money.

You get it right? It&#039;s just a simple equation. Niche x Offer = Result. Don&#039;t worry about picking your niche just yet in this video. I&#039;m going to show you in this week, week one, we&#039;re going to go over in detail how to pick you niche, how to construct your offer, how to construct your message and all of that stuff. Don&#039;t worry about that, we&#039;re covering it soon.

Let&#039;s conclude this training video. We started off with what is natural law and why it&#039;s of extreme importance. I told you how natural law is the governing laws of the universe. Why do things happen the way they do? It&#039;s just cause and effect. That&#039;s how things happen. Cause and effect and time. Cause and effect is the governing equation of everything. When we put time in there and time is now how people think. People think time is just a straight line, they think it&#039;s linear. They think if they don&#039;t save a dollar today, that in 10 years time, the only difference will be a dollar. It&#039;s a lot more than that. If you choose not to save a dollar today, the different in 20 years time can be millions of dollars. One action doesn&#039;t just have the same reaction over time. It exponentially compounds.

Cause and effect in the governing equation and that equation is C+PExT^D. That&#039;s current situation plus our plan times our execution of that plan to the power of time equals our dream. We want to play with that formula until we can figure out exactly how we can achieve our dream.

Why most people suffer as a victim to life due to fallibility from knowledge, memory and time. We talked about how most people don&#039;t seek wisdom. Most people go to school, go to college and they&#039;re like, &quot; I don&#039;t need to know anything else,&quot; then they&#039;re walking around on the street and they wonder why things aren&#039;t going their way. &quot;I wonder why I don&#039;t have any money. I wonder why I don&#039;t live in the house I want to live in. I wonder why my car is useless and breaks down all the time. I wonder why things seem to be out of my control.&quot; Most people wonder these things. They don&#039;t stop to think, well maybe it&#039;s because I haven&#039;t learned how things work. Maybe it&#039;s because I forgot. Maybe it&#039;s because I just don&#039;t know how to time thing works.

Knowledge is extremely important. You must keep an open mind, you must learn. Memory is extremely important and understanding that your memories can be wrong. I had so many memories of how things were that I had to completely pull back up and I figured out they were actually wrong. I had to let go of those memories. In time, I had to figure out how time works. I had to understand that you can&#039;t really cheat time. I had to understand that if I choose to put off my dreams today, then I could be putting them off three years, four years, five years. I realized that taking an action today is so, so, so important.

The 8th wonder of the world which Einstein said was compound interest on every single action you take in your life. When you&#039;re going through life from now on and you&#039;re thinking of watching Game of Thrones today instead of taking action on your business. Instead of picking your niche today, instead of making some phone calls today, instead of doing this training today, instead of doing anything today. If you put that stuff off, you have no idea what you&#039;re doing to the future. You could be putting that stuff off for years. You want to think like that. It sobers people up when they think like that.

Consulting equation. Niche time offer equals result. What&#039;s the specific group that we&#039;re targeting? What&#039;s their problem? What&#039;s their desired situation? Now offer, what are we offering to them and what result are we getting? We&#039;re grading that. We&#039;re trying to get that combination as potent and powerful as possible. We&#039;re understanding that this is the most important thing out of everything. This is more important than Facebook ads, more important than YouTube ads, social media, tweeting or going to speak at some event. This is everything. If we get this right, you can mess everything else up. This pretty much sums up our training today. That&#039;s it for this video. I hope everyone enjoyed it and I will see you in the next one.
