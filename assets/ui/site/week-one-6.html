                        Hey everybody, Sam Ovens here and welcome to this training module in the Consulting Accelerator Program called Crafting Your MVO. MVO stands for Minimum Viable Offer. This is something which I introduced to the consulting industry which is shaking things up, and it&#039;s a different way of thinking about our offer and our services. In this video, I&#039;m going to explain the traditional, classical way of thinking and how most consultants put together their offers, and how most consultants provide value.

Then I&#039;m going to talk about this new way of thinking and this new way of crafting an offer, which involves as little of you as possible. It&#039;s a totally different way of thinking. The normal way of thinking is to provide as much information and as much hours and time as possible. My way of thinking is to provide as little of you and as little of your time as possible, so totally different way of thinking. Let&#039;s jump right in and get started with this training.

At this point in week one, you should have done all of these things. You should&#039;ve watched all of the training videos in week one, which is videos 1 to 5. You should&#039;ve watched them from the start to the end. You should&#039;ve watched them in full, and you should&#039;ve done all of the worksheets. This video here, it&#039;s not going to make any sense to you and you&#039;re not going to be able to complete this video and it&#039;s totally a waste of time watching this video or going any further past this point unless you&#039;ve done videos 1 to 5 and done all of those worksheets.

If that&#039;s you, just quit out of this right now. Go back and do the work. Remember, you don&#039;t want to be here just to listen to my voice. You&#039;re here to get results. You&#039;re here to get clients. You&#039;re here to make money. You&#039;re here to make a change, improve things. You&#039;re not going to do that by just listening to my voice or skipping through some videos. Don&#039;t fool yourself. Go back and do that now.

You should&#039;ve watched all the videos in week one, videos 1 through to 5 in full. You should understand what a consultant is, the true definition of a consultant, and you should understand what types of services they offer and what forces drive them. You should really start to understand conceptually how a consulting business works, all these different concepts, all of these forces which all tie together to put together a successful consulting business.

Most people think that business is just by chance or some sort of luck. Most people think that really successful businesses are too complicated or that they just happen by sheer luck or something. Well, if you&#039;ve watched videos 1 to 5 in full, you&#039;ll know that there&#039;s nothing to do with luck here. It&#039;s just cause and effect. We&#039;ve refined consulting down to an exact, precise science. You just have to do the work and you just have to follow the process.

You should understand the difference service models and all of that, and you should&#039;ve selected your niche and completed all three of the market research worksheets. You should&#039;ve picked your niche. You should&#039;ve completed those worksheets, and don&#039;t be one of those people that really fence sits on the picking the niche thing, because I can tell you that everyone, every single person I know, pretty much, has ended up changing niches a couple of times. Don&#039;t worry about it.

The people who I&#039;ve seen who sit at the starting lines, trying to pick the perfect niche and overthinking it, they never pick a niche. I look back three years later, four later, they still haven&#039;t found that perfect niche. However, I find the people that pick a niche, they find out whether it&#039;s wrong or write, and then they adjust and pick a new niche. Even if they&#039;ve cycled two or three niches, well, they&#039;ve ended up on the right one and they&#039;re already making money before the other person has even made a choice to start.

Don&#039;t fool yourself. Just pick a niche. You don&#039;t need to put that much thought into it, because this is an iterative process where we test things and sometimes we have to change things around. There&#039;s no such thing as a wrong decision when you pick a niche, and you should&#039;ve completed all of those market research worksheets. Now, like I said, this video is not going to make any sense to you unless you do that, so please go back to that right now. If you&#039;ve done all of that, awesome. Let&#039;s go.

Let&#039;s start with the big mistake most people make when it comes to crafting a consulting offer or when it comes to coming up with what services you offer. Most consultants and most service providers and coaches and all of those people, when they come up with what it is that they&#039;re going to sell, they do something like this, they think of their offer as a bag, like a brown paper bag, and they think of value as just more stuff in the bag.

Imagine your offer is a bag, and then if someone is like, &quot;Well, how can I provide a lot of value to my client, how can I charge more, how can I get people better results,&quot; like, &quot;What is the fundamental driving force of value,&quot; and most people think it&#039;s just more stuff in a bag. This is a totally flawed way of thinking. I mean, sure, this sort of thinking was correct when people were buying a whole bunch of sand or gravel or something back in the Industrial Revolution sort of times, but when it comes to consulting, this is totally the wrong way of thinking.

Here&#039;s the big thing which you have to learn. People don&#039;t care about you. Seriously, nobody cares about you, especially in business. Don&#039;t take this the wrong way. This isn&#039;t supposed to be some personal attack or anything like that. This is a business lesson. In business, people don&#039;t care about you, plain and simple.

People don&#039;t care about your qualifications. If you&#039;ve got an MBA, or MB-whatever, any letters behind your name, people don&#039;t care. If you have a fancy suit, people don&#039;t care. Go to a fancy office, nobody cares. If you&#039;ve got a really awesome social media profile, cool photos of you eating sushi, cool photos with some dog, no one cares. If you&#039;ve got a fancy book, no one cares. The New York Times Bestseller, no one cares. Your partnership with Oprah, even, no one cares. No one cares about any of this stuff.

That might surprise a lot of you. You might be like, &quot;What? Surely if we had an MBA and surely if we had a nice suit and a nice office and if we had a really awesome social media with lots of followers, and if we had a book, a bestselling book, and if we were on Oprah and we can put that all on our website and have a fancy website, surely that would mean that we would make a lot of money, right?&quot; Wrong. This is the current school of thought. This is the current worldview that everyone has. They think that the more social stigma they collect, the more money they&#039;re going to make. That is the wrong way to think.

People don&#039;t hire you because you&#039;re famous. People don&#039;t hire you because you&#039;ve got a lot of followers. People don&#039;t hire you for any of this stuff. It&#039;s a totally flawed way of thinking, and not only that, it&#039;s selfish thinking. In business, all someone cares about is their transformation and their results, plain and simple. If you don&#039;t believe me, let&#039;s take a trip to the dentist to really cement this idea and cement this concept for you so you thoroughly understand what I&#039;m talking about.

Imagine that you&#039;re going to the dentist and you&#039;ve got a sore tooth, you&#039;ve got this tooth and you&#039;re in excruciating pain, your whole mouth swollen up. You can&#039;t do anything else. 100% of your conscious attention is on this tooth because you&#039;re in agony. Now, let&#039;s say, you arrive at the dentist&#039;s and then you go into the waiting room and you see him and he says to you, &quot;Okay, well, look, it&#039;s going to take me about 10 minutes to remove this tooth and fix everything up, and the price is going to be $1,000.&quot; Then you&#039;re like, &quot;Wait, what? $1,000 for 10 minutes? That doesn&#039;t sound fair. If it only takes you 10 minutes, then it shouldn&#039;t be $1,000.&quot; Then the dentist replies and he&#039;s like, &quot;Well, if you want, I can take a couple of hours.&quot;

Just think about that for a second. You&#039;re in excruciating pain. You come in there. This dentist says he can remove the tooth 10 minutes, 1,000 bucks, and then you&#039;re like, &quot;What? That doesn&#039;t find fair.&quot; He&#039;s like, &quot;Okay, well, I can take two hours if you want.&quot; Are you going to get him to take two hours instead? Of course not, you want that tooth out as fast as possible.

Truthfully, someone would pay more money to have it done in less time. If some dentist offered a two-hour procedure that cost $1,000 and another dentist offered a one minute procedure that cost $3,000, pretty much, everyone is going to be taking that $3,000 one minute procedure because they don&#039;t want to be in the dentist for that amount of time.

People have gone and gotten everything confused. People think it&#039;s all about how much work you do and what sort of degrees and everything you have. People think it&#039;s about you, but it&#039;s not. It&#039;s about the market. It&#039;s about the niche and their problem and solving their problem and getting to their desired situation.

What we can learn from the software world and their Minimum Viable Product, MVP. In the software world, we know, where people build applications and things like that, there&#039;s this concept called an MVP. It stands for Minimum Viable Product. Basically, what happened in the software world is a lot of these software applications keep getting built and people started just adding tons of features into these things. They were making them more complicated, more complicated, more complicated, more complicated, and the industry turned into a place where people would just add as many features as possible. That was how they thought that they made their product better than someone else&#039;s.

At the end of that like the shopping bag mentality, most software companies thought of their application as a shopping bag, and they figured the more stuff they put in the bag, the better. They would build tons and tons and tons of different features, and they&#039;d end up with these massive complicated rocket spaceship sort of software applications. Then what happened is people were like, &quot;Man, this software is just so confusing. It&#039;s got so many buttons on it. It&#039;s so complicated. All I need to do is just send an email.&quot;

Then what started happening is a few people, a few disruptive people came up with the idea called the Minimum Viable Product. That was the minimum amount of features so that you could actually just satisfy the customer, just satisfy, just cover his needs. What happened is if someone needed an application just to send emails, well, they would build a Minimum Viable Product which just mean it could only send emails. They didn&#039;t add any of these other features in there. They just left it bare bones.

What started happening is these companies started disrupting the companies that made very complicated software products? Then in the end, a lot of the market were like, &quot;Well, I&#039;d rather a simple program or a simple software application than a big complicated one.&quot; The market started turning toward Minimum Viable Products instead of going with these big, fancy, complicated software programs.

The same is true in consulting and in coaching and in offering services, because we have to remember why people hire consultants, and it&#039;s this here. People hire a consultant because they&#039;ve got their current situation, where they are right now in life, exactly where they are right now, and then they&#039;ve got their desired situation, which is because every human has a desired situation. It&#039;s just human nature, so that&#039;s where we want to be in the future. That&#039;s how we want to see ourself. That&#039;s where we want to be. That&#039;s our dream.

A consultant is an expert at solving a particular problem and helping somebody make a particular transformation in their life or their business. Simply put, a consultant is someone who helps someone go from their current situation to their desired situation. That&#039;s a consultant. I&#039;m introducing the idea of the Minimum Viable Offer, otherwise known as an MVO. We&#039;re going to refer to it throughout this program as an MVO or a Minimum Viable Offer. Just like in software, they have the Minimum Viable Product, which has the least amount of features possible in order to solve the problem and satisfy the customer&#039;s needs.

Well, in this new age of consulting which I&#039;ve created, we&#039;re going to be using Minimum Viable Offers, which means we&#039;re going to be providing the least amount of us, and the least amount of services, the least amount of time humanly possible just to satisfy the customer and solve their problem. Simply put, on this diagram here is the minimum amount of things you can do to bridge this gap for your target niche. You&#039;ve got your target niche. You know their current situation. You know their desired situation. Well, an MVO is the minimum amount of things you can do to bridge this gap for your target niche.

Let&#039;s say bye-bye to all of these things, which the classic, old, traditional way of doing consulting and coaching and all of those things. It&#039;s going out the door. This stuff is going in the trash. We&#039;re saying bye-bye to proposals. No more. This program is going to teach you how to never do proposals again. They&#039;re a waste of time. No one even really reads them, and most people that ask you to do a proposal are just too afraid to tell you that they&#039;re not interested anyway, so bye-bye.

Deliverables, no, we&#039;re no longer doing deliverables. We&#039;re not going to say, &quot;Well, here&#039;s a list of these deliverables,&quot; because no one wants deliverables. Reports, we&#039;re not going to do any reports. We&#039;re not going to do billable hours. A lot of consulting and coaching companies, they charge you per hour. They might have $100 per hour fee. No, this way of consulting is totally different. We&#039;re going to escape all of these shackles and chains, and bespoke quotes and projects, quoting up different jobs, doing totally custom thing here, totally custom thing there. Nope, that&#039;s not a way to run a business.

We&#039;re going to say bye-bye to all of these things, because if you can get somebody results, they don&#039;t care about anything else, and that&#039;s the truth. If you can get someone from their current situation to their desired situation, they don&#039;t even care how you did it. For me to really drive this point home, the humans pretty much ... If you want to know what the ultimate offer is, it&#039;s pretty much a solution in pill form, because humans are lazy and they don&#039;t want to do much work. If you can put something in a pill form, then humans are going to buy that stuff.

If you could help someone get to their desired situation with a pill, I mean, you&#039;d be one of the richest people in the world. If you could help a company get more customers by just swallowing a pill, they would take the pill any day. Do you think the customers wants to go work with a consultant and spend multiple hours doing all of this stuff? No, they don&#039;t want to talk to anyone on the phone. They don&#039;t want reports. They don&#039;t want deliverables and proposals. They don&#039;t want any of that stuff. We&#039;ve gotten confused.

All they wanted is their desired situation. The least amount of things and friction possible to get them there is what they want. A lot of people think that it&#039;s their work and their qualifications and their Facebook page and their show with Oprah and their YouTube channel and, oh my God, it goes on. People are focusing on the wrong things.

A lot of people thing you need a really pretty website and you need to do YouTube videos, you need to be on Instagram, you need to do all of this stuff. Well, go look at my website. Go look at my Instagram. Go look at my Facebook. Go look at all of those things, and they&#039;re really bad. I haven&#039;t done a blog post in more than two years. I haven&#039;t done a YouTube video in more than two years.

I&#039;m not saying you have to not do anything, but I&#039;m telling you that I have achieved everything I&#039;ve done without any of that stuff. I don&#039;t have a book. I&#039;ve never spoken on a stage. I&#039;m the last person Oprah would know. I am far from famous. Pretty much, no one knows who I am. I&#039;m totally undercover. I&#039;m shocking at social media. I&#039;m an introvert. I don&#039;t do blogs or any of that fancy stuff. Then how come I&#039;m able to make more than $18 million a year? Well, this year, around $50 million without any of that stuff.

It&#039;s got to get you to question that stuff, because, truthfully, if you could get somebody results, they don&#039;t care about anything else. While other people have been obsessing over their social media and their websites and all of those things, I&#039;ve been obsessing over my customers. I&#039;ve been making sure that they get results. That&#039;s why if you look in our Facebook page it&#039;s just back-to-back-to-back people getting results, because that&#039;s all that people care about.

I don&#039;t care if someone is like, &quot;Dude your website has got a spelling mistake.&quot; I don&#039;t care if someone is like, &quot;Sam, you should be using Instagram because it&#039;s the best place for business.&quot; I don&#039;t even have a Snapchat. If someone tells me to get a Snapchat and they think I&#039;m an idiot for not having it, I think they&#039;re an idiot for thinking Snapchat is more important than their customers&#039; results. Truthfully, I know that if I can just focus on getting my customers the best results possible, everything else will look after itself. People will talk about my programs. They&#039;ll say, &quot;Sam&#039;s stuff is really good. Sam&#039;s stuff works.&quot; The rumor mill will start up.

I know that that&#039;s more powerful than marketing and all of those things. People didn&#039;t buy the iPhone because Steve Jobs was on Oprah or because Steve Jobs had an awesome Instagram with him eating different types of yogurt. That&#039;s not why people bought the iPhone because it was the best damn phone there was. It was a really good value, and so that tell you you&#039;ve got to start thinking about things.

No one cares about you, your Instagram, any of those things. People only care about themselves and their transformation and their results. It&#039;s a total shift in thinking. It&#039;s a good shift in thinking, because truthfully, the other way of thinking is pretty selfish and it&#039;s not really serving anybody but yourself. Ironically, it&#039;s not even really serving yourself, because, by doing it, you&#039;re actually hurting yourself.

To drive the point in, if you can get somebody results, they don&#039;t care about anything else. Let&#039;s create your Minimum Viable Offer. I&#039;ve driven home the theory behind this thing. I&#039;ve told you why it&#039;s important, and it&#039;s really should be a no-brainer. This is just very simple black and white sort of thing. Minimum Viable Offer is the way things should be.

There&#039;s three cardinal rules of a Minimum Viable Offer. Rule number one is talk about the transformation and the results not about what you&#039;ll do for them. A lot of people, when they offer people their services, they say, &quot;Oh, I have this very unique process, and basically, what it involves is I&#039;m going to do 100 hours of this. I&#039;m going to come to your office. I&#039;m going to be sweating. I&#039;m going to hook up all of these computers into your system. I&#039;m going to be doing so much work that you&#039;re going to be blown away.&quot;

No one wants that. Truthfully, if I hire someone to do something and they tell me they&#039;re going to be rummaging around my office for days and sweating and doing all this stuff, I don&#039;t want that. That&#039;s the last thing I want. I prefer not to even meet the person. I just prefer for them to fix it and be done. We shouldn&#039;t talk about what we&#039;re going to do for them. We should only talk about the transformation and the results. We should talk about taking them from their current situation to their desired situation and what life is going to be like when we do that.

Rule number two is pricing on value, so we want to price on the value of having this transformation not the hard costs or time involved with you delivering it. The classical school of thought, the classical way of thinking is that we should charge per hour, and then the cost of our services will just be determined by how many hours we do.

Well, that&#039;s silly, because that is really just encouraging the consultant to spend as much hours as possible on it, which isn&#039;t good for you and it&#039;s not like he&#039;s going to want to try and get it done real quick because he&#039;s getting paid per hour. That&#039;s a silly way of thinking. That&#039;s a totally mad way of pricing things.

You shouldn&#039;t price on how much it cost you. You shouldn&#039;t calculate how much gas it cost you to drive out to the office. You shouldn&#039;t calculate the air fees or how much paper you used or how much a staple costs, the pen and the pen that you are writing with. You don&#039;t price things that way either. You price on value. What is it worth for someone to have this problem solved? If someone has got a company and it&#039;s losing $10,000 every single month, well, what&#039;s it worth for them to fix it? Well, it&#039;s worth a lot. They&#039;re currently losing 10 grand a month.

If you could help someone solve their problem and it was only going to take you half an hour, you shouldn&#039;t just charge $50. Value pricing, people would think, &quot;Well, if this guy is losing 10 grand a month. It&#039;s only going to take them half an hour. Therefore, I&#039;m going to charge 50 bucks, because if I was on an hourly rate, I&#039;d charge 100 bucks, so $50 is fair.&quot; No, you want to charge based on value.

If this guy stands to fix his business and he&#039;s going to stop losing 10 grand a month, well, really, paying even 10 grand for that would be worth it, because in one month, he&#039;s going to have already paid for the service. Now, in the future months, he isn&#039;t losing money anymore. You see, it&#039;s a different shift in thinking, pricing on value instead of the costs of delivering the services.

Rule number three, only include the bare minimum of you to achieve the transformation. The classic way of thinking is to put as much of you in there as possible. We want to give them a 50-page report every two days. We want to give them a follow up, but we want to have a check-in call every second day for an hour. We&#039;re going to send them weekly reports. They&#039;re going to have our phone number so they can text us at anytime, 24/7, even if we&#039;re asleep. This is what crazy people do.

They just keep giving more and more of themself to the point where they&#039;re ... That&#039;s how they think that value is created, just by giving away more and more of themself, and it&#039;s getting to the point where a lot of people will pretty much just cutting their arm off and pretty much offering that to the guy, and it&#039;s crazy.

People don&#039;t want you to be waking up in the middle of the night. People don&#039;t want to be texting you. People don&#039;t want any part of you at all. You are not the solution. People want the result. People want the transformation. Truthfully, they want as little of you as possible because all they want is the result.

When we&#039;re crafting our Minimum Viable Offer, we want to put in the smallest amount of you possible, and truthfully, if we don&#039;t need to put any of you at all in, that&#039;s better. We want to have that thinking. Only put it in if we absolutely must, only if it&#039;s mandatory in order to achieve the transformation.

Let&#039;s talk specifics. If you&#039;re selling done-for-you services, this is where most people are going to start off in the consulting game. If you&#039;re new to consulting, brand new. If you&#039;re in the early stages, done-for-you is where you are going to be starting, because we discussed this in the evolutionary stages of a consultant. A consultant typically starts with done-for-you, because that&#039;s the most desirable.

It means that customers are most likely to pay for this one. They want it the most. It&#039;s the easiest to sell. It&#039;s the easiest way for you to get clients and start making some money, but not only that, it&#039;s the best way for you to learn. If you&#039;re new, you need to learn. You can&#039;t go immediately into advising and immediately into coaching and online programs if you haven&#039;t learned and mastered your craft from done-for-you stages. Most people are going to be starting off with done-for-you services.

Here&#039;s some different questions, and now, you should have done a lot of these different things when you were doing your market research, and I&#039;m going to show you our Minimum Viable Offer worksheet in just a moment, which is a download available below this video in the resources section. I&#039;m going to walk you through some questions you want to start asking yourself if you&#039;re doing done-for-you services. What is the desired situation of your target market or niche? You know their current situation. What is their desired situation? Where do they want to be in one year, six months? What is it? What is their desired future self? Define it. Write it down.

How can you get them there with a done-for-you monthly service? Now we know where they want to go, okay? Nice and clear, we know where they are, current situation. We know where they want to go, desired situation. How can we get them there? Can we get them there with a done-for-you monthly service? If someone has got an accounting business and they want more customers, can we offer Facebook ads and some basic landing pages and funnels in order to get them more customers for their accounting business? What we do is a monthly done-for-you service.

What is it costing them to stay where they are without fixing this? Like I was saying, if somebody has a business that&#039;s losing 10 grand a month, if they don&#039;t fix that problem, well, how much is that going to cost them? Well, every single month, that 10 grand is going to keep racking up the bill. Over the course of 12 months, that&#039;s going to cost them $120,000. A lot of people think that if they don&#039;t hire a consultant that they&#039;re saving money. Truthfully, it&#039;s costing them more money. If someone has a problem and they don&#039;t hire us, they don&#039;t pay money to fix it, then eventually, they&#039;re going to end up paying for that anyway and they&#039;re not going to have it fixed.

What is it costing them where they are without fixing this? We want to determine a value. We want to think, &quot;Well, how much is this costing?&quot; If you&#039;re in a niche that isn&#039;t business, if you&#039;re in a niche like weight loss or binge eating or yoga or meditation, this isn&#039;t just financial. There can be emotional costs. What is it costing someone emotionally to have this extra weight on them? There&#039;s going to be a lot emotional costs there. They&#039;re not going to have energy. They&#039;re going to feel down. They might miss that new promotion at work, because they just can&#039;t keep up with the day-to-day things.

What is the value that the service will bring to them each month? If we fix this problem, what do they stand to make? If we get someone out of the hole, losing 10 grand a month, and now we get them up to making 10 grand a month. Well, now they start to make 10 grand every month. Now they&#039;re really going to start making some money. What is the value that this service will bring to them each month? Really define that. If you&#039;re doing a business thing, define it financially. If you&#039;re in a niche that&#039;s non-business, define it emotionally.

Now, what you want to do is price your done-for-you service between about $1,000 and $10,000 a month. Now, how you price things, I think no one should be offering a done-for-you service that&#039;s less than $1,000. Truthfully, if you can&#039;t charge $1,000 a month for your done-for-you service, then you haven&#039;t chosen a problem that&#039;s painful enough.

Look, there&#039;s enough people in the world, there&#039;s enough niches, and there&#039;s enough people with problems that, I&#039;m telling you, there are tons of problems out there you could solve that people would happily pay a grand a month for. There are millions of them, so don&#039;t think all of the good things are done. Don&#039;t think, &quot;Oh, I can&#039;t find anything,&quot; because you&#039;re obviously, you haven&#039;t even started or you haven&#039;t tried or you haven&#039;t tried hard enough, because they&#039;re out there. They&#039;re everywhere.

You want to be pricing your done-for-you service between a grand and 10 grand a month. You want to think about it like ... You want to be pricing on value. If you&#039;re helping someone that save an extra 10 grand a month in their business, and they&#039;re going to be making an extra 100 grand, 120 grand this year, a good way I&#039;d like to think about things is pricing on 10% of value. If we&#039;re going to help somebody solve ... What was I saying? If we&#039;re going to help somebody fix the problem in their business that&#039;s costing them $10,000 a month, if we were to price on 10% of that, that would be a $1,000 a month for our done-for-you service.

It&#039;s not just financial. It can be emotionally too. There are people who are overweight or unhealthy or people who really want a girlfriend or a wife and they don&#039;t have a relationship. Trust me. People would happily pay $1,000 to solve their problem. These are things which keep them awake at night. These are the things which ... These thoughts are in their mind every day. It&#039;s plaguing their lives.

People pay any money that they can, even any money that they have to solve a really painful problem. People even find money that they don&#039;t have. They&#039;ll take loans, get out credit cards, they&#039;ll do anything to solve a painful problem. I&#039;m telling you, there&#039;s enough painful problems out there that you can find one where you can charge at least a grand a month. I want everyone in this program to have ... If they&#039;re done-for-you services, I want your pricing to be at last $1,000 a month. It could be anywhere up to 10 grand a month or more.

Now, if your selling coaching services, so this is if you are a little bit more evolved in the consultant&#039;s journey, which we talked about in the evolutionary stages of consulting, which was a previous video in this week one training. This is if you&#039;ve gone through the done-for-you stuff and you&#039;ve learned your market, you&#039;ve learned your niche and you understand things now. Now, you don&#039;t have to do all of the work for people, because your advice is valuable on its own.

Once you start to know enough about something, you don&#039;t have to do all of the work, because people don&#039;t see you as an order taker or a grunt who is going to do all of the work. They more see you as someone who has refined and superior knowledge. Now they&#039;re willing to just pay you for your advice alone and then do the work themself or pay someone else to do the work for them.

If you&#039;re selling coaching, which I&#039;m sure most people are going to be starting with done-for-you. You don&#039;t start with coaching, you start with done-for-you first, and then you evolve into coaching. If you&#039;re in coaching, what is the desired situation of your target market or niche? We know where they are right now. We know their current situation. What is their desired situation? What does that future look like? What do they look like themself in their desired future? Let&#039;s define this. Let&#039;s get a pen. Write it down. Let&#039;s put this into a sentence. It&#039;s so important that we put things into sentences. If they&#039;re just thoughts, then we&#039;re going to forget them and we&#039;re not going to make progress, we&#039;re going to gain any traction.

That&#039;s the first question. What is the desired situation of your target market or niche? Then the second one, how can you get them there in six to 12 weeks with your training program or advice. Now that we know their current situation and their desired situation, we know what they want. We know the gap which they want to bridge. This is everything to them. They want to become this person. They want to be their best self. They want to get into this future position as quickly and as painfully and as easily as possible. You know this now.

Well, how can you get them there in a six to 12-week training program or with six to 12 weeks of advice? You could create an online program, like the one you&#039;re going through now, or you could create a coaching program, which means that the person has a call with you every one week for six weeks, and you&#039;re going to go through a process and solve it for them, or you could do it as a group coaching program, where you get a whole group of people together and you do group calls via webinar or teleconference, whatever, and you coach the group through this process.

What you want to do is if you want to do coaching, take the time to really map that out. What would it look like? Can you do it in six weeks, or is it going to take more like 12 weeks? We typically don&#039;t want to go over 12 weeks with a training program. It&#039;s getting a bit too long. Truthfully, most transformations, most things can be fixed in less than 12 weeks, so the shorter, the better.

Now, what is it costing them to stay where they are without fixing this? Just like in the done-for-you situation, if someone has a business and they&#039;re losing 10 grand a month, if they don&#039;t fix this problem, it&#039;s going to keep costing them 10 grand a month. Over the course of a year, that&#039;s going to cost them 120 grand. Like I said, a lot of people think they&#039;re saving money by not hiring a consultant. When really, they&#039;re losing money because if they don&#039;t pay for the consultant, they&#039;re just going to keep losing money.

Now, what is the value of them achieving this transformation? If they fix this problem, what is it worth to them? Now, you want to price your program between two and a half thousand and 10,000, maybe even more. Again, you want to price on value. If your advice and your coaching program can make an extra 100 grand in their business, then you should probably charge 10,000 for that. If they stand to make about 25 grand, you should charge them two and a half grand for that. It could be emotional. It doesn&#039;t need to be financial. It can be emotional. People pay just as much money. Sometimes people pay way more money to solve emotional things than to just solve financial things. You can price your program between two and a half and 10 grand.

Now, typically, if you&#039;re doing coaching or any sort of program, I don&#039;t think you should be charging less than two and a half grand. You want to be solving a problem which is painful enough. You want to be making a very, very profound transformation for someone. There&#039;s no point getting into consulting and coaching and all other stuff just to help someone to make an incremental improvement.

You want to choose and tackle a big nasty problem, and you want to help someone make a profound life-changing, earth-shaking transformation, because the bigger the transformation, the nastier the problem, the more money someone is willing to pay, and the more eager they&#039;re going to be to sign up for your services and all of that stuff. Make sure you tackle something meaningful.

Now, a word of warning, never skip the stages on this roadmap. In the earlier video in week one, it&#039;s called Evolution of a Consultant. We covered the evolutionary stages of a consultant in the consultant&#039;s journey. If you didn&#039;t watch that, go back and watch it now. It&#039;s critically important. Typically, a consultant goes through these different stages as they evolve. They start off doing generalist stuff. Then niche consulting. Then they master their niche. Then they get a proof of concept. Then they transition in doing coaching and group coaching, one-on-one coaching, all of this sort of stuff.

Now, it&#039;s really important that you transition from doing done or you, and then go into coaching, because if you skip done-for-you completely, then you&#039;re probably not going to have much luck coaching or doing online programs or anything because you haven&#039;t had time to master the craft, you haven&#039;t had time to learn how things are done. Never skip the stages on the roadmap. Don&#039;t think you can create an online training program before you&#039;ve learned the ropes doing done-for-you, one-on-one coaching, group coaching, things like that.

Now, what if you&#039;re unsure about your offer? Let&#039;s say you have defined your offer, but you&#039;re really unsure about it. Let&#039;s say you&#039;re unsure about your niche. Let&#039;s say you aren&#039;t sure about your offer and your niche. Well, welcome to how everybody. I, myself, used to be unsure about my niche pretty much every single day. I constantly used to think about switching niches, and I did quite a few times. I started side projects. I niche jumped.

I call these people niche jumpers, because they&#039;re constantly just jumping into a new niche because they&#039;ve got shiny object syndrome. They see a new niche and they&#039;re &quot;Oh, this one is good,&quot; and they jump to it. A lot of people think the grass is always greener on the other side, but it&#039;s not. The grass is always greener where you water it. It didn&#039;t take long before I noticed it didn&#039;t really matter what niche you picked. If you stuck to it and you mastered it, you could make a lot of money.

I just decided to stick with something. I just stuck with consulting. I figured it out. I learned the ropes. I mastered it and, my word, was it worth it. I&#039;m so thankful that I didn&#039;t switch niches. I doubted myself every day. I know all of my top students, the people who make six figures, the people who make millions, all of the people that you know and have seen on my videos and testimonials, they&#039;ve all doubted their niches too. Don&#039;t worry about it. It&#039;s normal. It&#039;s totally normal, totally healthy for you to be unsure about your offer and unsure about your niche. Like I said, everybody is. It&#039;s just how it is.

Now, crafting a nerve striking, hair raising, credit card out now offer takes iterations and improvements over time. I think a lot of people think that a really, really awesome offer, people just come up with it, like first pop. You can see, my business now, I&#039;ve got the domainconsulting.com. I&#039;ve got some nice branding. My videos are starting to look a little bit better. I know quite a lot about my niche. My offer is pretty powerful. My messaging is all good and everything and I deliver results for my clients.

You might look at them and be like, &quot;Whoa, that&#039;s a nice offer. That&#039;s a really cool offer.&quot; Well, let me tell you that it did not start like that. It started so scrappy and so rough that you probably couldn&#039;t even believe it. I was super, super, super anxious and doubtful when I launched it. This is what most people have to understand. No one starts out with an awesome offer and total confidence in their niche.

Everything is going to feel imperfect. You&#039;re going to doubt your niche. You&#039;re going to doubt your offer. You&#039;re going to think that it sucks. That&#039;s how everybody feels about their first version. It&#039;s totally normal. It&#039;s healthy. It&#039;s how everyone has felt, including me, and all of the millionaire students, and all of the other tens of thousands of people that have come through this training.

Now, remember the consulting equation? It&#039;s what we covered in the earlier video which was Natural Law in the Consulting Equation. Well, it looks like this. We&#039;ve got the niche, the offer, and the result. What happens in this middle stage is the niche comes into contact, it collides with our offer, and the two wrestling there, and then the outcome of that is the result.

Well, we use scientific method and cause and effect to figure out what works in terms of our niche and offer. We start out by forming a hypothesis that includes a niche, an offer, and a result. Then once we have that hypothesis, we go to the market, which is our laboratory, and see whether we are right or not as well as collect feedback.

I think a lot of people think when they pick their niche and come up with their offer that that&#039;s it. It&#039;s set in stone. It&#039;s like we&#039;re grabbing a big truck of concrete. We&#039;re getting this think called a niche. We&#039;re putting it in a mold, and then we&#039;re just pouring a ton of concrete on it and it&#039;s fixed, and it&#039;s there forever, and it&#039;s just stuck. I think that&#039;s how most people think that they pick their niche and how they craft their offer and all of this. It couldn&#039;t be further from the truth.

When you pick your niche and when you craft your offer, it&#039;s totally flexible. You&#039;re going to change it. You&#039;re going to improve it. You&#039;re going to iterate it. You might change niches. You might offer something completely different. It is an iterative process. No one can get it right in their own head, and no one can get it right on their first try because we&#039;re not our customers.

We have to come up with what we call a hypothesis, which is something which we think is going to work. We come up with what we think is going to work based on our research and based on our observations and everything, and then we take our hypothesis to our laboratory, our lab, and this the market. The only place where you can test a hypothesis is in the market. The market is the true judge of everything.

Your own brain isn&#039;t the judge of anything. Your own brain is a place where people get lost, people end up hurling themselves into festering pits of self-doubt. People end up just tormenting themselves in their own brains thinking about stuff. A lot of people think that they&#039;re smart by overthinking a whole bunch of stuff. Well, they&#039;re not. People who overthink a lot of stuff just end up torturing themselves with worry.

What we do is we use our own brain to come up with a hypothesis, what we think is going to work, and then the only way we can actually tell if that&#039;s going to work or not is by going to the market, our niche, or our laboratory. Then we test in the real world with real people and we see whether we are right or not. We see whether our hypothesis was correct. We get what we call feedback.

Like I said, nothing is a failure in business. People have got this weird understanding of failure like if someone sees no worth, if it doesn&#039;t work, then it&#039;s bad and we should get under our duvet cover, curl up into a ball and just start crying. No, that&#039;s not how it works. When someone says no to you in business, it&#039;s not like you&#039;re getting dumped by your girlfriend of boyfriend.

When someone says no to you in business, you are getting feedback. We want feedback. It&#039;s good. When someone says no to us, we say, &quot;Okay, well, can I ask why?&quot; They tell us, and now we learn, and now we go back to our hypothesis and we take notes. We&#039;re like, &quot;Well, we learned this from this experiment.&quot;

Then we go back out to the market. We try it again. We keep trying it again. We keep trying it again. We might get a yes. We might get a no. Either way, it doesn&#039;t matter, because every no is providing us with feedback, and every yes is providing us with feedback. Yes is also providing us with money and clients too, but we have to start seeing things as feedback. The only way to get feedback is by going to the market.

Our process looks like this. Our niche, and our offer, and our result, and this middle stage here which I&#039;ve got highlighted in gray, this is our variable. This is our offer. This is the thing which we&#039;re going to be tweaking and testing. We&#039;re going to come up with a hypothesis about what our offer is, and then we&#039;re going to go to the market, and we&#039;re going to be asking them, we&#039;re going to be pitching them our offer.

We&#039;re going to see how they react. Based on how they react, we can either tell hypothesis, change things around a bit, collect feedback, and we&#039;re going to keep ever so slightly changing our offer, changing things just a little bit, and we&#039;re going to be playing around in this middle section here until the result on the other side is exactly what we want.

We picked our niche. We know our niche. Then we ask our niche what their problem was, what their current situation was, what their desired situation was. Their desired situation is the result, so we put that on the result side. We know the left side of the equation and we know the right side of the equation. We know the niche is this person or this group of people, and we know the result is their desired situation, which they told us. The only missing variable is the offer.

Well, after those, come up with a hypothesis, and then test that. We have to go to the market with what we think it is, and then we&#039;re going to interact with the market, and we&#039;re going to see if our offer is right or not based on whether it gets them the result or not. We have to iterate and improve on this section. It&#039;s a process, and it takes some time to get it perfect, but don&#039;t worry, you don&#039;t have to have a perfect offer to start making money. You can start making money and getting clients with an imperfect offer.

It&#039;s just, I think, a lot of people, they compare themselves to a company like my one or an offer like my one, and they&#039;re like they think they need to get it to this level before they can even start. That&#039;s not true at all. If you try and get it to this level, it&#039;s impossible. It would take you five years and will cost millions of dollars to get to this point. It&#039;s impossible to do on your first go.

Let me tell you this right now. Nobody comes up with a savage offer on the first attempt. By savage, I mean an awesome offer, something which really gets people&#039;s attention, just gets them to pull their credit card out and pay. No one comes up with that, with a savage offer on the first attempt.

All dangerous offers started out as guesses and hypothesizes and involve iterations and improvements to get them to where they are now. Everyone&#039;s offer, my offer or my millionaire students&#039; offers, all of my six-figure students&#039; offers, all people you know and think of, they all had to go through an iterative process to get their offer all sharpened and honed.

Not iterations and improvements inside the entrepreneurs&#039; head. This is very important. I think a lot of people think that they&#039;re doing constructive iterations and improvements, they&#039;re testing their hypothesis in their head. It doesn&#039;t work. I remember I told you the example, you are standing on one side of the road, Susie is sitting at a bus stop on the other side of the road, and we have to guess what does Susie want for lunch.

I mentioned how long we could think about that one for. We could read every book. We could read everything on the internet, and we could talk with every consultant in the world, we&#039;re not going to know what Susie wants for lunch. Only Susie knows what Susie wants for lunch. At some point, it&#039;s better to just walk across the road and ask, and that&#039;s why we come up with a hypothesis, and then we go over to the market and we test.

Iterations and improvements with real feedback from the market itself, and this is what I call the true laboratory. A lot of entrepreneurs sit in their bedrooms and they sit behind their computers, and they never talked to their market. They never do anything, and they wonder why they don&#039;t make any money and they wonder why people don&#039;t buy their stuff. Well, it&#039;s because you need to get your stuff into the true laboratory. You&#039;re not even in the laboratory when you&#039;re in your own head. You need to use the market. You need to get into the true laboratory.

This is what we&#039;re trying to do in the real laboratory. It&#039;s like a chemistry experiment. It&#039;s like a science experiment. We&#039;ve got our niche. We choose our niche. We define who they are, then we come up with our offer based on what the current situation and the desired situation of the niche is.

Then the only way to test whether we&#039;ve selected the right niche and whether we&#039;ve crafted the right offer is to go the market itself and pitch and sign clients up and test. Give them our offer. Provide our services until they get the result. It&#039;s the only way to learn. This is the only way to get feedback. You have to go to the true laboratory, which is the market.

Let&#039;s talk about why people mess this up. Most people mess this up because they form a Niche-Offer-Result hypothesis without speaking to the market. They form a Niche-Offer-Result hypothesis, no kidding, without ever speaking to the market at all. They think, &quot;Oh, I&#039;m going to start a business. I&#039;m going to become a consultant.&quot; Then they sit on their couch and they think in their own head.

They&#039;re like, &quot;What do I think people want. I know I&#039;m going to offer people this. I&#039;m going to help people with their logos, and I&#039;m going to help people organize their desktops, and I&#039;m going to help people use Google Drive. Yeah, that&#039;s what people want.&quot; That&#039;s not what people want. You have to go to the market. If you come up with a Niche-Offer-Result hypothesis in your own brain, then it&#039;s not going to work.

Another one is they form a Niche-Offer-Result hypothesis, and then never test it with the market. They form a Niche-Offer-Result hypothesis, and then they think about it in their own brain, &quot;Do I think this is going to work, or do I not think this is going to work? I&#039;m sure it&#039;s going to work. No, I&#039;m sure it&#039;s not going to work.&quot;

They have this argument with themselves day after day, month after month, year after year, until they&#039;ve tortured themselves and hurled themselves into a snake-infested pit of self-doubt. You can&#039;t test anything in your own head. Your own head is dangerous. You need to take it out to the market. It needs to get some oxygen. It needs to breathe, and it needs to see whether it can work in the real world.

Forming a Niche-Offer-Result hypothesis and expecting it to work on the first version without adjustments. Someone might come up with a Niche-Offer-Result hypothesis, and then they might go out and speak to the first prospect that they see, and the first prospect says, &quot;Oh no, sorry, I don&#039;t really want this.&quot; Then they run home. Curl up into a ball. Get under the duvet and cry.

Of course it&#039;s probably not going to work on the first time. I mean, I&#039;ve seen people&#039;s Niche-Offer-Result hypothesis work on the first time, but it&#039;s just not normal. Mine didn&#039;t. Most people don&#039;t, because it&#039;s your guess. If you guess something, then it&#039;s probably not going to be right, but that&#039;s fine, because in business, it&#039;s about collecting feedback. Failure is not failure. It&#039;s feedback.

If someone says no, we ask why. Well, now we learn. Now we can make a better guess next time. We go to the next person. We try them. If they say no, we try this next person, and over a few iterations and improvements using this process, we can figure out what the right thing is, and then, bam, we get a strike. We get our client. It&#039;s just a process of iterations and improvements.

Someone might form a Niche-Offer-Result hypothesis and not make any revisions or adjustments based on market feedback. I see this one quite often. Someone might form a Niche-Offer-Result hypothesis, like I saw someone the other day and they said that they offered SEO to dentists, and they wanted to grow their business, they wanted to grow their business to 100 grand a month. I said, &quot;Okay, well, if people aren&#039;t buying it, then we have to be open that maybe dentists don&#039;t want SEO,&quot; because he had gone and convinced himself that they want SEO, but they don&#039;t.

They want a result, and there&#039;s other ways to get people a result without SEO. He&#039;d keep going out to the market, keep going out to the market, and the market was giving him feedback, but he wasn&#039;t listening. His ears were closed. Someone might form a Niche-Offer-Result hypothesis. Go out to the market, and then not make any adjustments. They just keep it fixed, rigid, and they&#039;re like, &quot;I wonder why people aren&#039;t buying it.&quot; Well, you&#039;ve got to listen to the feedback. You&#039;ve got to adjust it and make revisions and adjustments, iterations and improvements.

Another one is forming a Niche-Offer-Result hypothesis and confusing constants for variables and making a big mess. Let me explain this in a bit more detail. Let&#039;s get this straight right now. You can only have one variable at a time. In a scientific experiment, you have a constant and a variable and a result. I&#039;ll give you very basic stuff here. Let&#039;s say we want to measure the boiling temperature of water with different ... We want to measure how long it takes for water to boil with a Bunsen burner based on the different Bunsen burners.

Well, if we&#039;re going to do that experiment, we need to keep the water the same. We want to have the same volume of water, and we want to have the same beaker every single time. That has to be kept constant, and then our variable is the thing which we&#039;re testing, which is different Bunsen burners.

If we go out and we change the water every time, we put a massive jug of water in one time, tiny amount of water in the next time, some salt water in the next time, and we&#039;re changing these Bunsen burners at the same time, our experiment is going to be a big mess. We&#039;re not going to know anything. We have to hold a constant, and then we have to have a variable.

It&#039;s the same in business, because we use a scientific method for everything we do with consulting, because this process isn&#039;t about chance. This process is precise science. Here is how it works for us. We&#039;ve got a constant, a variable, and constant. What we know is our niche, because we pick our niche and we know who they are. That&#039;s a constant.

Then we know their desired result, because we find out what their current situation is. We find out what their desired situation is, and then their desired situation is the result. Desired situation, result, the niche is the niche. We&#039;ve got both sides of this equation here. We&#039;ve got the constant and we&#039;ve got the other constant.

Now, we&#039;re only going to be changing and playing with one thing here, which is the variable. That is our offer. We come up with an offer and we test it, and if it doesn&#039;t work, we get feedback, and then we might adjust the offer a bit. Then we go and test it again. It doesn&#039;t work, so we keep adjusting the offer and we keep going back to the market and testing. Over a few tests, we&#039;re going to figure out what the right variable is. We&#039;re going to find out what offer, what exact thing we can offer when paired with a niche equals the result that they want. There&#039;s just no doubt about it. We will find it, and we&#039;ll find it surprisingly quick.

Where most people go wrong is they have multiple variables. They go to the niche and they have their offer, and they make an offer to them, and the person says, &quot;No, I&#039;m not interested.&quot; Then they go home and they decide to change their niche, and then they change the offer too. Then they go back and now they&#039;ve got two variables. Now, well, we&#039;ve just blown up the whole experiment.

You can&#039;t do that. You can&#039;t change two things at once. You can&#039;t change your niche and change your offer and keep doing that. You&#039;re just going to make a big, big mess, and you&#039;re not going to learn anything it&#039;s a waste of time. You have to keep a constant and you have to have a variable. We pick a niche, and then we try different variables with this niche. If we try a whole bunch of different variables and we can&#039;t seem to crack the niche, then sure, we might have to swap out the niche, but for most of the time, we&#039;re keeping that niche the same, we&#039;re keeping that niche as a constant.

Let me give you an example. Our niche constant could be accountants. We decided we want to help accountants. Then our offer variable could be Facebook ads and funnels. Then the result, constant, is they want more clients. Accountants want more clients. This could be our hypothesis, our Niche-Offer-Result hypothesis. We think this is our niche, accountants, they want more clients, and then our offer, we think we&#039;re going to use Facebook ads and funnels, now we go out in the market and we test that. It either works or it doesn&#039;t, and we collect feedback and we adjust the offer slightly each time.

Let&#039;s make this extremely simple. I want to really get this point simple, because a lot of people torment themself when they come up with an offer. They&#039;re like, &quot;Oh, I can&#039;t pick my niche. Oh, I don&#039;t know what to offer.&quot; Pick anything as your niche, offer anything as your offer, and just make a start, because then you&#039;re moving. You need to get some motion before you can actually start playing around with things. It doesn&#039;t matter how long the scientist sits on his coach thinking about what Bunsen burner is going to work. It&#039;s better for him just to get up and start trying some random Bunsen burners.

That&#039;s how it works in business too. People sit at the starting lines for too long. People sit on their coach like the scientist trying to think. You don&#039;t know. It&#039;s impossible to think that. We&#039;re taught in society that thinking is real good. If you think for long enough, you&#039;re going to find the answer. That couldn&#039;t be further from the truth. You need some data. You need to go to the market. You need things to compute. Your brain can&#039;t find the answer.

If we make this as simple as humanly possible, we have a lock, a lock on the door. Now, the lock is your niche and their problem. Let&#039;s say this is accountants and they are struggling to get clients. Then we&#039;ve got unlocking the lock. What does that mean? Well, that&#039;s getting the niche their results. That&#039;s getting accountants more clients, right? We&#039;ve got a lock, and we&#039;ve got unlocking it is the result.

Then we&#039;ve got the key. Now, the key is your offer. Your offer is supposed to go into the lock, which the niche, and it&#039;s supposed to get them the result they want that&#039;s supposed to open the door, right? Very simple. Most people don&#039;t ask the market anything. They don&#039;t pick a niche. They don&#039;t come up with a random offer. They come up with a random offer, and they assume a random result.

Seriously, this is how most people start a business. They think, &quot;I&#039;m going to start a business,&quot; and then they&#039;re like, &quot;Screw talking to the market. Those people don&#039;t know anything. I know what people want. People want help with Google Docs. Yup, that&#039;s what they want.&quot; Then they don&#039;t pick a niche. They&#039;re like, &quot;Why pick a niche? I&#039;m just going to market to everybody in the world, because people who choose niches are suckers, because there&#039;s only a small group of people. I can target 8 billion people.&quot;

Then they come up with a random offer, so then they think, &quot;Yeah, I&#039;m going to help everyone in the world with Google Docs, and I don&#039;t really know what that&#039;s going to do for them, but it&#039;s going to help them with Google Docs, because, yeah, that&#039;s an awesome offer.&quot; They assume a random result. They&#039;re going to be like, &quot;Yeah, I&#039;m pretty sure if people had help with Google Docs, then they&#039;d be able to make more money. Yeah, that&#039;s right.&quot;

It might sound comical. It might sound like I&#039;m being an idiot, but I&#039;m really being serious here. This is how most people come up with the offers. This isn&#039;t stupid people. I&#039;m talking about a lot of people. I see grown adults people who have university degrees. I see people who are pretty smart come up with things like this. It&#039;s crazy. People act kind of crazy when they start a business.

Imagine this. Imagine walking to a random door. Just imagine you walk up to a random door and assume that what&#039;s behind that door is good. You&#039;re like, &quot;Oh, I know something awesome is behind this random door.&quot; Then picking a random key to try and open it. You&#039;re just like, &quot;No, I&#039;m just going to pick anything. Here, this key. I know this key will work.&quot; Then trying to open it and then being sad that it didn&#039;t open, so quitting and never trying again. Yup, that&#039;s most people, and I&#039;m not even joking.

Our scientific method, how was it different. How are we different from most people? Well, we pick a good door and a good lock to try and open, which is our niche and their problem. We pick a niche. We do our research. We really pick something. We have a focus. Then we do our research to make sure that what&#039;s behind the door is something that the niche actually wants. We don&#039;t assume the niche wants anything. We find out for sure. We don&#039;t assume that Susie wants sushi for lunch. We walk across the road. We ask Susie. We find out if she wants a kebab. We&#039;re like, &quot;Okay, well, we&#039;re going to do that.&quot;

We do our research and we find out what our niche wants. We find out their current situation. We find out their desired situation, and we make sure that what&#039;s behind the door is something that this market is going to want. Then we do the research to make sure that what we have is the best possible ... We do our research to make sure that we have the best possible guess at what key will open it. That&#039;s our offer and our message.

We look at who is doing the best in this market. We talk to different people. We do our research on blogs. We complete our worksheet. We do everything in week one, and we come up with what we have, our Niche-Offer-Result hypothesis. Then we form a Niche-Offer-Result hypothesis on what we think is going to unlock the door. We come up with our hypothesis which is what we think we&#039;re going to work before we go out to the market and test it.

Then once we formed that hypothesis, we then test it on the market. We go out to the market. We start selling it, and we see what people say. We see if they say yes or no. We see if it&#039;s right or wrong. We collect feedback. Remember, nothing is a failure. It&#039;s always feedback. Then we adjust our variable and our Niche-Offer-Result hypothesis based on feedback from the market and we try again. We go out to the market. We pitch them. We get some feedback. We come back. We adjust a little bit. We keep going back to the market. We keep going back. We keep going back. We keep going back, changing things a little bit each time, trying out different keys, seeing what fits.

It looks like this, remember? Niche-Offer-Result, we&#039;ve got a constant, a variable, and a constant. We&#039;re only changing the variable and we&#039;re keeping these other things constant and we&#039;re seeing which one fits. We&#039;re seeing which key fits, because when you find that key that fits, bam, you&#039;re making money, bam, you&#039;ve got clients. There&#039;s nothing more awesome in the world when you find the right key.

I figured out the right key for a lot of things, and that&#039;s how my business just literally just prints out money, like 100 grand a day, just printing it, because I&#039;ve used this method and I have figured out all of these things. It wasn&#039;t by chance. I can tell you right now, I didn&#039;t sit on my couch and think. I didn&#039;t just come up with something in the shower. I didn&#039;t just have a dream one day. I went out and I tried things. I collected feedback. I adjusted it.

This is how all nerve striking offers evolve. Every single awesome offer you could possibly think of in the world, this is how it evolved. Enough of talking about the theory of it, I&#039;m sure you thoroughly understand Minimum Viable Offers now. I&#039;m sure you understand all of the driving forces and the concepts and everything behind it. You know how it works. You know the theory. Let&#039;s put things into action. Let&#039;s create your Minimum Viable Offer right now.

We&#039;ve got two worksheets to complete in this module. Your MVO worksheet, which stands for your Minimum Viable Offer worksheet and your Niche-Offer-Result hypothesis worksheet, this one is an ongoing work in progress, so you&#039;re going to do a lot of these worksheets over the course ... I&#039;m still doing these worksheets because I&#039;m still trying to improve my Niche-Offer-Result hypothesis.

Let&#039;s pull this up right now. These are available for download below. These are available for download below this video on the resources section. We start with your Minimum Viable Offer worksheet. Now, you can pull this up. You can download it as a PDF, or you can download as a PDF and then click the link there, and it&#039;ll open a Google Doc. You can complete this. You could print it out and write it by hand or you could just complete the Google Doc and save it into Google Docs, totally up to you.

What is the niche? Question number one, write it down. Define it. What is their current situation? We should know these things by now. We could just pretty much copy what we&#039;ve written down in the other worksheets, but we want to keep writing these things down, so we keep drumming it into our brain. I still try and write this stuff down every day, because I don&#039;t want to forget it. I&#039;m like, &quot;What is my niche&#039;s current situation? What is my niche&#039;s desired situation?&quot;

What is it costing them to stay where they are? Defining that, we talked about it before. What would it be worth to them to get their desired situation? What do they stand to gain? We talked about that before. Then what are most niche participants doing to try to bridge to their desired situation and how well is it working for them. This is a good question to ask.

People in the accounting industry that want more clients, what are they doing? They know what they want, so they&#039;re obviously doing something. Find out what they&#039;re doing and write it down. It doesn&#039;t matter if what they&#039;re doing is wrong. It is wrong, otherwise, they wouldn&#039;t have this problem, but we want to know what they&#039;re doing.

Then what are most niche service providers offering participants to their desired situation? Other people the market, people who are doing what you&#039;re doing, what are they offering to this niche? What they&#039;re offering, how well is that working? Not just for the participant, is it helping the accounting get more clients, but also, how is it going for the service provider. Is he getting clients? Is he making money? Does he have a good business? Do a quick analysis. Write it down, what&#039;s going on.

Then what are the niche participants who are crushing it doing? You can ask accountants, who in the accounting industry is just destroying it? Who in the accounting industry is the rock star in the Rolls-Royce? Who is doing the best? Find out who they are, write it down, and then what are they doing? Write down what they&#039;re doing, and how was what they&#039;re doing different to everybody else. We need to get an understanding for who is doing what.

The people who are struggling, what are they doing? Then the service providers, what are they offering, and how well is that working for the service providers who are selling it and for the people who are buying it? Then the rock stars, the Rolls-Royces, what are they doing? We want to see how all of these things are different. It&#039;s really important to keep track of these.

Once you&#039;ve completed this Minimum Viable Offer worksheet, very simple worksheet. It&#039;s time to craft your first Niche-Offer-Result hypothesis. This is where things start to get fun. We&#039;ve been dealing with a lot of theory, which is really important because we need to understand how things work first.

If someone just goes out and starts taking violent ruthless action without any understanding for the forces at play, and any understanding for the theory and the conceptual understanding of this. This is going to be like trying to do something. You can have no idea what is going on. The theory is really important, but now once we get this worksheet done, it&#039;s time to get into some real fun stuff, which is we&#039;re almost ready to go to market.

The next one, once you&#039;ve done that, is your Niche-Offer-Result hypothesis worksheet. It&#039;s available for download below this video in the resources section. It&#039;s a PDF. You can download it. You can print it out and complete is a printed out copy, or you can click this link in the PDF and it will open up a Google Doc. You can complete it digital version, totally up to you.

We copy this from our other worksheet. What&#039;s the niche? What&#039;s the current situation? What&#039;s the desired situation? Then what version number is this hypothesis? We have our niche and we have our offer, and now that&#039;s our Niche-Offer-Result hypothesis, but the first time we do it, this is going to be version number one, because what we do is each time we change things a bit, we create a new hypothesis. We keep track of things.

This worksheet, you can use again and again over the course of years. I&#039;m not saying it takes years to start making money. I&#039;m just saying you can use this. I still use this stuff. I&#039;m on to my I don&#039;t even know how many version of my Niche-Offer-Result hypothesis. It&#039;s hundreds. You keep creating new ones each time you&#039;re testing something new.

You&#039;d write version number one, and then when it comes to what works and what doesn&#039;t, let&#039;s determine signal from noise. What I mean by that is signal is things that are working and things that get results, and noise is things that don&#039;t work and don&#039;t get results, but they&#039;re usually real hyped up and often have people salivating over them even though they&#039;re of no use anyway, like getting on Oprah, kind of.

That&#039;s something that everyone wants, but many broke people have been on Oprah and they go to a surge of customers for a week, and then no customers, and then their business eventually collapse. It&#039;s not what they wanted anyway. Signal versus noise, what are the things that work and what are the things that don&#039;t work? Separate them, very important to do, because a lot of things that the niche participants thinks are signal are actually noise. You want to get some clarity on these things.

Then number six, based on the above, what is the minimum work possible that you could do to help your niche go from their current situation to their desired situation? If you&#039;re doing done-for-you, map out exactly what you&#039;ll be doing for them and how long it will take, really design your service, and if you&#039;re doing coaching, map out a six to 12-week program that will achieve this. You can take the time to do that. Then what is a fair but still on the high side price that you could charge for this offer? Come up with a price for this. Now, if you&#039;re doing done-for-you, it should be at least 1,500 bucks a month or at least 1,000 a month. If you&#039;re doing coaching, it should be at least 2,500.

Now we&#039;re going to grade things. Very simple, on a scale of 1 to 10, how certain are you of your niche, on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being totally certain, with 10 being uncertain? Grade it. Don&#039;t think too much about it. Just circle some. It&#039;s important to just keep a score of these things. How painful is the current situation of the niche from their point of view on a scale of 1 to 10? Grade it. How urgent is the desire for the niche to achieve their desired situation? How bad do they want this, 1 to 10? Grade it.

How complex is it to offer the solution? For you to get them what they want, how complicated is it? We don&#039;t want to do something that is so insanely complicated, because we&#039;re going to have a very hard time doing it. We want to do something that&#039;s simple but powerful, so grade it, 1 to 10. How possible do you think it is to truly achieve the desired situation of the niche on the scale of 1 to 10? Do you think that you&#039;re really pushing it to believe that you can the desired result for this niche, or do you believe that you 100% you can do it, hands down? Grade it.

Now, you want to add your rankings up from questions eight to 12, and you&#039;ll get a total out of 50. Then you want to write that total in there. Then what timeframe do you think it would take for you to achieve the desired situation in days? If you&#039;re going to be working with this niche and helping them grow from their current situation to their desired situation, how long do you think it would take you to get them there? Define it in days. You could say, &quot;10 days, 30 days, 100 days,&quot; whatever. Write it down.

Now you&#039;re going to have two things. You&#039;re going to have a grade out of 50 and you&#039;re going to have a timeframe in days. The higher your score, the better. The shorter the days, the better. We&#039;re looking for something that&#039;s short amount of days and a high score. To give you an example, for me, I&#039;m pretty much 49, 50, and my days it&#039;s like 30 days. I&#039;m a real tight timeframe and I&#039;m real high score, because I&#039;ve worked through iterations and improvements.

I&#039;ve really tested this thing. I&#039;ve been in the laboratory, which is the market. I&#039;m constantly out in that market. I am like a hawk in the market. I&#039;ve got my finger on the pulse of the market every minute of every day. If it moves a bit, I know about it. I&#039;m keeping a close eye on that thing. I&#039;ve got my eye closer. I&#039;m monitoring this market closer than anyone else on earth. That&#039;s how I know what&#039;s going on and I&#039;m able to make iterations and improvements, and I&#039;m able to keep a high score here and a tight timeframe here. I&#039;m able to dominate my niche because of that, so what is yours?

Now, we&#039;ve form our, what we call, part one, which is our pre-market hypothesis. This is what we think is going to happen, very important, what we think is going to happen. We don&#039;t know if it&#039;s going to right or not. Like I said, you can think all you want, you can get feedback from your mom and your dad or your friend, or your Uncle John. You can get as much feedback as you want, but the only way we&#039;re ever going to know for sure is by going and getting what we call live market feedback, going to the market, pitching them, making offers, and getting yeses or nos, signing up clients, doing real world stuff. That&#039;s what we call part two, live market feedback.

When you start going to your market, and when you start making them offers, and some people are going to go and make offers to their market right now, because if you know people in your market or if you can reach out to people in your market right now, do it, absolutely do it. Nothing should be stopping you from doing that right now. However, if you&#039;re new to this and you want to step through the processes, it&#039;s okay. You can start taking action after we&#039;ve covered the sales script and everything, which is in week three.

You can focus on week one on just getting your everything right in terms of your message, market, offer, all of that stuff. Then in week two, we can do some mindset stuff to make sure you&#039;re feeling confident and everything. Then in week three, we&#039;ll teach you how to sell. Then in week three, you can start taking and going out to the market. Typically, most people they wait until about week three to start going to the market. However, don&#039;t let that stop you. If you want to go to the market right now, do it. I encourage it.

Now, I want to walk through this section here now. However, please understand that you&#039;re not able to complete this until you&#039;ve actually gone out to the market. Most of you aren&#039;t going to complete any of this stuff until week three, but I&#039;m just going to walk over it now. Even though this is in week one, I&#039;m teaching you about it now, because when we&#039;re doing sales stuff in week three, you&#039;re going to be coming back to these worksheets and updating them.

What we do is as we start going to the market and pitching people, making offers, closing deals, we want to start crossing off the numbers as you start speaking with the market and testing your hypothesis by making them the offer in this hypothesis worksheet. You should make at least 20 to 30 offers before you judge your Niche-Offer-Market hypothesis. A lot of people judge their hypothesis. They think, &quot;Oh, this is a failure,&quot; or with the first person they talk to.

Seriously, you can&#039;t judge anything off one conversation. You need to have enough conversations so that you can get what we call statistical significance. 20 to 30 still isn&#039;t even really statistical significance if there&#039;s any smart stats people in here. I don&#039;t want anyone to pull me out from that. This is mountains better than what most people do. Really, you&#039;ll do more than this, but this is ... I know most people don&#039;t even do this, so this is light years of improvement for most people.

If you form your Niche-Offer-Market hypothesis, you go out there and you test it and the feedback isn&#039;t great after two calls, so what? It doesn&#039;t matter. They could just be two people who ... Two dud people. Even me, I still get more nos than yeses, but you&#039;re always going to nos than yeses, and so just because I get a no, it doesn&#039;t meant I run home and change everything. Even if I get a bunch of nos, I don&#039;t run home and change everything. I do enough calls, and then I look at the overall. I see, &quot;Okay, is this good or bad.&quot;

You want to get into the habit of doing at least 20 to 30 offers to real people in your niche before you judge anything. As you make each call, you can just cross these off. First call, bam, cross it off, second, third, da-da-da-da, cross them off, and you should do at least 20 to 30. If you want to do more, you&#039;re more than welcome to, but at least 20 to 30.

Then what objections is the market giving you? If they&#039;re saying, &quot;No, I&#039;m not interested, ask them why, write them down. What are the reasons why people are saying no? What objections? What resistance are you coming up against? What is the market liking or interested in? The things that you&#039;re talking about, what things piqued their interest? What things make them sit up in their chair and open their eyes wide? What things do they like? Write them down.

How are the conversations ending and what&#039;s the conclusion of each call. At the end, what&#039;s happening? Write it down. Then what patterns are emerging? After you&#039;ve done 10, 20 calls, you should be able to look back and be like, &quot;What similarities are popping up here? What patterns are popping up?&quot; Write them down. Everyone might be saying the same thing, write it down.

Based on the above, state ways in which you can improve your Niche-Offer-Result hypothesis. After you&#039;ve collected some data by going out to the market and selling, you can write down things which you can improve on. Then after you&#039;ve done 20 to 30 offers to your niche, using your Niche-Market-Offer hypothesis, collect all the feedback, and form ideas of improvement, now you can move on to another Niche-Offer-Result hypothesis. You can create version two. Then you go out and do 20 to 30 more, create version three. Then you go out and do 20 or 30 more, version four. Then you go out and do 20 to 30 more, version five.

Now, I&#039;m not saying that you have to do all of these different versions of your Niche-Offer-Result hypothesis to make money. A lot of people will start making money on version one, before they even get to the end of 30 calls. I&#039;m just saying that just because you&#039;re making money, doesn&#039;t mean you stop improving, because I don&#039;t know about you, I&#039;m assuming that people once they start making some money, they&#039;re just going to want to make more.

I mean, I think it&#039;s kind of crazy if someone gets a client for 2 grand a month, that is 24 grand a year, and then they&#039;re like, &quot;Oh, I know, I&#039;m not going to do anything now.&quot; It&#039;s silly. If you can do something, you should do more of it. You should make it better. I&#039;ve designed this course not to just teach you how to get a client, but I&#039;ve designed this course to really make you a beast. I&#039;ve designed this course to make you absolutely reign over your market, control everything. The market is not going to know where you came from, because this is seriously dangerous information if it&#039;s in the right hands.

I want to teach people how to dominate. I don&#039;t want to teach people how to just get a client or two. You go through iterations and improvements. You keep improving this hypothesis. You keep coming back to the laboratory, which is the market. You keep testing. You keep testing, because as you get that key sharper, which is your offer, as you learn more, as you keep getting better, you start making more and more and more and more money, and things get easier and easier and easier for you.

Before long, people are buying from you. You couldn&#039;t even try and stop them. For me, every time I go to sleep, by the time I wake up, pretty much, made 30, 40 grand. I&#039;m not even joking. It&#039;s just by the time I wake up, and then by the end of the day, it&#039;s about 100, 220. It wouldn&#039;t change if I was asleep for the whole day or in another country or anything. That&#039;s a lot of money. Most people are like, &quot;Oh man, if I just made 100 grand a year, I could do all this cool stuff.&quot; I&#039;m making 100 grand a day, and I&#039;ve being serious. You keep improving this hypothesis if you want to absolutely crush it, this is what you do.

Back to this, you want to complete your Minimum Viable Offer worksheet, print it out or to complete the Google Doc. Then you want to complete your Niche-Offer-Result hypothesis worksheet. You&#039;ll only be able to complete part one, because part two, you actually have to start selling. Now, some people will start selling now, that&#039;s cool. You can start completing that part now, but if you want to wait until you&#039;ve done the mindset and the sales stuff, that&#039;s fine. You can wait until week three and you won&#039;t be able to complete that part of it until then.

It&#039;s important to understand this isn&#039;t a do it once, sit and forget thing. You&#039;re constantly improving this. You Niche-Offer-Result hypothesis worksheet is an ongoing and constant and continual work in progress. Remember, it&#039;s all about testing your hypothesis against the market, not about testing it in your head, not about asking other people in the Facebook group what they think about your offer, because the people in the Facebook group might not be in your niche.

Let me give you an example. Let&#039;s say I&#039;m selling $100,000 construction cranes, full-blown cranes that lift stuff up to 50-story buildings, right? They&#039;re $100 million. Am I going to go into the Facebook group and ask people will they buy my offer? No, I couldn&#039;t even afford those cranes. You&#039;re asking the wrong people. The Facebook group is great to get motivation. It&#039;s great to get some feedback and everything.

Your mind is great for thinking and your parents and friends and family, they&#039;re great for stuff too, but when it comes to testing your offer and your ideas, no one can tell you what&#039;s going to work other than the market. The market is all that matters. The market is the only true laboratory. Any other laboratory is a figment in your imagination, only the market, and you want to test your niche, you want to test your hypothesis against the market, collect feedback, and iterate and improve from there.

Just remember, it&#039;s like this, three-sided equation, you&#039;ve got your constant, your variable, and your constant. We know our niche. We know what they desired result is, and then we just have to try different variables until we figure out which one fits, and then we want to keep improving from there and keep improving and keep improving. No awesome offer was created on the first guess, and the only thing that&#039;s separating you and your offer, from me and mine in making 100 grand a day, plus, is market feedback, iterations, and improvements. That&#039;s it. You could make this much. You just have to iterate, improve, keep going.

That concludes today&#039;s training on crafting your Minimum Viable Offer. This is a really important module, probably one of the most important in week one. Make sure you complete those worksheets. Take the time to do it. Put in the work because I know this feels like stuff ... A lot of people, they&#039;re like, &quot;Oh, I just want to do the Facebook ads,&quot; or &quot;Oh, I just want to sell stuff.&quot; This is the real gold mine.

By the time we go to Facebook ads, I&#039;m going to show you how to do Facebook ads better than anyone else on the planet, but it&#039;s not going to work well if you&#039;ve got some lame offer. Even with my skills in Facebook and my skills at selling, I can&#039;t sell a bad offer. I can&#039;t advertise a bad offer on Facebook. It won&#039;t work. The most important thing is the offer. In Facebook ads, just like throwing gasoline on the fire.

If I don&#039;t have a good flame, there&#039;s no point on throwing gas on it. Probably just put it out. That&#039;s what we&#039;re doing in week one. We&#039;re building a strong flame, so that by the time we teach you how to sell, by the time we get your mindset all tuned up, and by the time we get you doing Facebook ads and things like that, it&#039;s just going to go (makes explosion sound) and things are just going to explode.

Take the time, put in the effort, really make this stuff awesome in week one, because your foundation is everything. Like I said, you can&#039;t build an awesome house on bad foundation. It&#039;s just going to fall over. Take the time to do it, put in the work, and I promise you, it will pay dividends for the rest of your life. That&#039;s it for this module. Make sure you do the work. Make sure you do the worksheets, and I&#039;ll see you in the next training right now. Thanks for-
