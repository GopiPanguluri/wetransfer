                        Hey everybody, Sam Ovens here and welcome to the final training video for week one in the  Consulting Accelerator Program. I hope you&#039;ve been enjoying it so far, hope you&#039;ve been enjoying week one and I hope you&#039;re coming to this last video having done all of the worksheets and watching all of the videos in full.

Don&#039;t watch this video until you&#039;ve watched all of the other videos in full and completed all of the action items and all of the worksheets because like I said, this program is made to be completed in sequential order for a very good reason because when it&#039;s completed in sequential order, you get results.

Things work. When I say things work, you get clients, you make money, you change your life, big impactful things in there so you definitely want to follow the program, follow the program process because this stuff works. In this video here, we&#039;re going to be talking about resonating your message.

We&#039;re going to talk about what your message is like what is your message, why is it important and how do we use your message and what makes a good message, what makes a bad message and how do you create your message. We&#039;re also going to talk about resonating like what do I mean when I say the word resonating.

This is a very powerful training and it&#039;s going to help you take your message from ... It&#039;s going to take it from a very blunt object and you&#039;re going to be able to really sharpen this thing up, razor sharp to have. One of the sharpest, if not the sharpest messages in your entire market because this is a very powerful training module.

Let&#039;s jump right into it. Here&#039;s a quick overview of what we&#039;re going to talk about. What is your message and why is it important? How to transition from selling raw materials to selling solutions and futures and the mechanics of a nerve-striking message that raises hairs on your prospect&#039;s arms.

There&#039;s some visceral language in that sentence there and that good message does, it strikes a nerve, it gets attention and it makes people sit up in their chair a little bit. We&#039;re going to talk about what goes into creating one of those messages and how you can create your very own one today with this training.

Today, I&#039;m going to talk about the message equation. You&#039;ve probably noticed by now that for everything in consulting, I have created ... I&#039;ve really boiled it down, distilled and turned it into a precise exact science like a lot of people think that business is up to hope and chance and a lot of people think that things just happen like things are random.

The whole are of starting a business and the whole area of making money, changing your life and starting a consulting business specifically until this point in time has been a very gray area but I&#039;ve turned it into a precise and exact science. I&#039;ve created equations for everything and just like we&#039;ve had the consulting equation.

We&#039;ve talked about the governing equation for evolution or we&#039;re going to talk about the message equation. How we can use a very simple equation to craft and hone the perfect message and then we&#039;re going to talk about how to construct what I call your message hypothesis. Just like in the previous training video, how we had your niche offer result hypothesis.

Now, we&#039;re going to talk about your message hypothesis and how you&#039;re going to come up with that so that you can go to market and start collecting feedback. When I say go to market, I mean go out and start communicating with your niche, real life people in your niche, making offers to people, selling stuff to people, making money and getting clients and really starting to make a difference and have some impact. The fun stuff.

We&#039;ve been working on a lot of theoretical things which have been very important because I need to show you inside your own hid how consulting works. You need to really click and be like, &quot;Ah, that&#039;s how things work.&quot; That was important to do, however, now we get in towards the end of this theoretical stuff now that we&#039;ve got a solid concrete understanding of how it works.

We&#039;re going to get into the fun stuff which is taking action, starting to get out there into the market and starting to get clients and make money. When I say go to market, we&#039;re going to use this message hypothesis that you come up with today to actually go out to the market and start communicating with people. Things are about to start getting exciting.

Then I&#039;m going to talk about resonating your message through our iterative scientific process. Just like a good offer, just like a good anything, on your first attempt, on your first guess, it&#039;s probably not going to be perfect and that&#039;s just normal. I&#039;m going to talk about how to continuously improve and iterate on your message so that you can really start sharpening it up and getting it into a world class message that really gets people, gets everyone in your market to sit up straight, raises the hairs on their arms and they just get out their credit card and buy. That&#039;s what a good message does.

I&#039;m not just going to show you how to create a message but I&#039;m going to show you how to continuously sharp and hone and refine that message to get it to that point where it can do that because there&#039;s nothing more awesome than when you have a message that&#039;s crafted to their point. What is your message? What do I mean when I talk about your message? Well, let&#039;s break it down. Let&#039;s get a very clear understanding of what your message actually is.

You&#039;ve got your market niche. This is the niche that you selected. Say it&#039;s an accountants or yoga instructors or plumbers, whatever, you&#039;ve got your market niche then you&#039;ve got you, the observer and you&#039;re the observer because you&#039;re looking from the outside of the niche into the niche and you&#039;re observing their behavior, you&#039;re observing their wants, their needs, their desires, their problems.

We&#039;re looking from a highly ... we&#039;re being an observer. We&#039;re taking a view on the market and we&#039;re being like, &quot;What do these people need? What do these people want?&quot; Other things that these people are doing, are they wrong or are they right? How can I help these people? That&#039;s what you&#039;re doing as the observer and then you&#039;re coming up with your offer.

In the previous video, the one ... just before this week, we talked about crafting your MVO, your minimum viable offer. This is the minimum viable thing that you can do, the minimum viable service that you can offer to these people, your niche in order to help them bridge the gap between their current situation and their desire situation. The minimum thing that you can possibly provide to help get them at the future that they want. That&#039;s your offer.

We&#039;ve got these three things together at this point. We&#039;ve got your niche, we&#039;ve got your the observer, we have trained you on how to take a view on the market, you understand the mechanics and the forces that drive a good consulting business. We&#039;ve crafted your minimum viable offer. We&#039;re got your offer ready. We&#039;ve got these three things ready right now. If we group you, the observer and your offer together and then on the other side, we&#039;ve got your market niche.

You need a way to communicate with these people. You need a way to get the attention of your market niche and you need a way to get your offer in front of these people like just having a offer and just knowing how consulting works and having a niche, it&#039;s not enough. There&#039;s a missing link and if you had the best offer in the world and you knew the most you could possibly know about consulting and you had the best niche in the world, nothing&#039;s going to happen.

No sparks are going to start flying like that because you need a way to get it in front of them and your message is the thing that we use to get you and your offer in front of your market niche. Your message is how you communicate your offer to a market and get the attention. It&#039;s really how ... It&#039;s the link that enables you to communicate and get the attention of your niche.

You want to think of your message like this. Why don&#039;t I mention your market niche is over there on this left side and then you&#039;re the observer and your offer are over here on this right hand side. Then you&#039;ve got two antennas like a TV antenna, just any antenna. You&#039;ve got your one up and then your market niche has got their one up.

You want to imagine everyone always has their antenna up. Where you&#039;ve got to start sending a signal, you&#039;ve got to stop thing a signal over to your market niche. A really good messages, a good message uses the right channel and resonates with the market niche to get their attention and communicate effectively.

A channel, we&#039;re going to talk about later on in this program but different channels, we could use direct mail. We could use email. We could use Facebook advertising which I&#039;m going to teach how to be an absolute ninja in later on in this training. There&#039;s lot of different ways that we could use as a channel but then your message is what goes down that channel.

When I say resonate, I mean really get on the same wavelength, really transmit that signal from your side over to their side and communicate effectively. The term I invented is called market-message resonance and this is when the market which is your niche and your message  really resonates and gets on that same wavelength.

You can think about it like this. You&#039;ve got these different wavelengths and they&#039;re going across, your market niche has got their wavelength and then you&#039;re playing around with your message and you&#039;re trying to guess which wavelength to get it on as well. Market-message resonance is when you tune your message to get on the same wavelength as your market niche.

It&#039;s pretty much impossible to get a market message on the first part to have it perfectly resonate with your niche. You start out, you have a guess and you think this is going to work and then it&#039;s an iterative process to get it to perfect. Once you do get it, bam, right on the perfect wavelength, it&#039;s like nothing else. It&#039;s like all your market knows about, all they hear about, all they think about, all they even dream about is you and that&#039;s when you&#039;ve got the right wavelength.

In this video, I&#039;m going to show you really how to get on that same wavelength and how to achieve what I call market-message resonance. Once you&#039;d tune your message to be on the same wavelength as your market niche, you will easily get their attention. It&#039;s like all they can do is think about you. This what happens when you get on the right wavelength.

A simple way to think about it is to think of it like a radio station. When you&#039;re in a tunnel or you&#039;re in the countryside, you get a lot of noise and no signal. Noise is that sounds that&#039;s like ... I&#039;m sure everyone&#039;s heard that. When you&#039;re pressing the buttons on your radio trying to get this station and you&#039;re just getting some random nothing. It&#039;s just like, that&#039;s noise.

When you&#039;re in the countryside or in a tunnel, you get a lot of noise and you don&#039;t get any signal and the signal was when you could hear music or hear the voices of something and you can&#039;t hear anything. It&#039;s very frustrating. I&#039;m sure everyone&#039;s been in that situation where they&#039;re like, &quot;Ah, this is frustrating. This static sound, this noise sound is horrible. I just want to get a clear signal.&quot;

Sure everyone&#039;s been in that situation before. Most businesses think their niche doesn&#039;t buy, won&#039;t listen or is stupid because they don&#039;t seem to get their attention and sell them. I hear people every single day like business owners, consultants, coaches, you name it, just every type of business.

I hear everyone saying that their niche sucks. I hear everyone saying that their niche doesn&#039;t have any money and I hear everyone saying that, &quot;Oh, my niche is stupid. They won&#039;t listen to me or they think they know better than me and they won&#039;t buy or they keep saying they want to think about all of these different things.&quot;

Of course, they&#039;re blaming the niche. They&#039;re like, &quot;Oh, it&#039;s the niche&#039;s fault.&quot; Or &quot;It&#039;s this guy&#039;s fault. He&#039;s stupid.&quot; Well, truthfully, it&#039;s not really them. It means that your message isn&#039;t really communicating well because when you have a message that communicates well, you won&#039;t complain about your niche. I&#039;m here today to tell you that most businesses are shouting but all their market hears is noise.

Most businesses think that their niche won&#039;t listen, most businesses think that their niche doesn&#039;t have any money and they&#039;re shouting like they&#039;re literally on Instagram, they&#039;re on Facebook live yelling down the pipes at people. They&#039;re literally shouting and they&#039;re loud and they&#039;re spending money on ads and everything but it just doesn&#039;t seem to work because even though they&#039;re loud, all their market hears is noise.

Here&#039;s a printout which I&#039;ve got. It&#039;s another pin up. It&#039;s available for download below this video. This is something you might want to pin up on the wall or keep handy because it&#039;s really important to think about your message this way. Here&#039;s the quote. Most businesses are shouting but all their market hears is noise. Volume without signal only frustrates people and hurts their ears.

Instead of shouting, listen for feedback. Tune your message until it resonates deep into your market&#039;s bones. This is a pin up which you can have just to remember that just because you&#039;re making a lot of noise, just because you&#039;re doing some ads or something, just because you&#039;re doing posts, just because you&#039;ve taught to 20 prospects, just because you&#039;ve done anything, it doesn&#039;t mean that your markets actually hearing you.

A radio station can still be putting out a signal but if it&#039;s on the wrong wavelength, you aint hearing any music. It&#039;s very important to know that you want to make sure that your message is resonating with your market, you want to make sure that you guys are on the same wavelength and they&#039;re picking up on that message and it&#039;s really striking nerves because when you get your message tuned properly. Believe me. It is a very, very, very powerful force that will surprise you and your entire market.

When you get a message right, it&#039;s like all people ever see and all people ever hear and all people ever think about is you. You don&#039;t have to be very loud, you don&#039;t have to shout to achieve that. It&#039;s actually quite the opposite. I don&#039;t really do any shouting, I don&#039;t really do ... I&#039;m a pretty quiet, reserved person. I&#039;m an introvert. I don&#039;t post on the internet very often at all, almost never but when it comes to getting the attention of my market, I have tuned my message to really shake and resonate deep into the market&#039;s bones.

It&#039;s because I have used this process which I&#039;m going to show you today in this video, it&#039;s very powerful. What makes a good message? Well, here&#039;s a good example I like to use. Here&#039;s a raw lettuce, just a lettuce like you grab from the supermarket and if you go by a lettuce, it&#039;s around 49 cents. This is what we call the raw material. This is just a lettuce straight out of the ground as just a lettuce.

Now we have sliced, bagged lettuce and what&#039;s really interesting is that the sliced lettuce in the bag is only half of the actual lettuce that you get if you buy the whole lettuce. You&#039;re getting half as much actual food but somehow, it&#039;s so much more expensive. Now, this is six and a half times the price. How do you sell someone half of something and charge them six and a half times the price? You can go into any supermarket and go and look at this and it will make you wonder.

How does someone sell half the food and charge six and a half times the price? Because surely, people would just, people wouldn&#039;t buy there. Surely, people just want more lettuce. They don&#039;t want less lettuce and paying more for it. Well, it&#039;s a very, very good lesson in business and especially in creating a good offer and a good message because one is the raw material and one is the solution to a problem.

What I mean is just because people want lettuce, if people want lettuce then it means that they&#039;re wanting the raw material, however there are a lot of people who are very busy like there&#039;s business people, there&#039;s new moms and dads who aren&#039;t used to having children and they&#039;re very short on time and they&#039;ve hadn&#039;t much sleep. To people like that, time is more important than anything else.

If you want to wash a lettuce, if you want to slice it up and everything, let&#039;s say that it takes ... I don&#039;t know, 15 minutes or something. If someone that at their job makes like $100 an hour or something, 15 minutes is the equivalent of $25. Someone who very quickly runs the math in the supermarket, if they&#039;re working and they were used to being paid a 100 bucks an hour, they&#039;re like, &quot;Okay, I got to slice all those other lettuce. Well, if it takes me 15 minutes to prepare it, the equivalent of costing a 25 bucks, however I can just get this one for 349.

You see? Buying, selling the sliced lettuce that&#039;s already washed and everything, it&#039;s actually a solution to a problem. It&#039;s a way for busy people to get more time and time is worth money. It&#039;s very smart. They&#039;re actually selling half the lettuce and they&#039;re selling it for six times the price. In this world, you get everything handed to you, you get riches, you get respect, you get attention, you get the ultimate life, the ultimate business, you get everything when you sell solutions to problems.

However, when you sell raw materials, you&#039;re in a nonstop, never ending uphill battle against everyone else who&#039;s trying to beat you on price because every man with a farm who has lettuces is trying to beat this 49 cents price, however if you&#039;re selling solutions to problems, you&#039;re in another market on your own. This is really important.

This is the shift in thinking because there&#039;s a lot of people out there, the traditional school of thought and consulting and everything is ... Well, we&#039;re charge per hour and we just give people hours. People don&#039;t buy hours and anyone that goes looking for hours is looking for the wrong thing. People buy solutions. All right? It&#039;s all about solving a problem. It&#039;s all about taking someone from their current situation, to their desired situation and the way we bridge that gap is by positioning our consulting offer as the vehicle to get them now.

You want to transition from selling raw materials and processes to selling solutions. Remember back in the training, some of the earlier training modules in week one, we talked about how your niche is the perfect overlap of these three things. Your skills that you have or you can learn, the industries that you know and the market&#039;s needs and desires. I see that most people think it&#039;s their skills that are important but the most important force by far like by at least 500% more like 1,000% is the market&#039;s needs and desires.

The most important thing of all is the market&#039;s needs and desires. the market&#039;s needs, wants and desires are the most important thing and I know I might be sounding like a robot by now but we&#039;ve gone through a lot of training in week one and I&#039;ve really driven this point home but it&#039;s so important because a lot of people think that it&#039;s about them, a lot of people think it&#039;s about their skills whether they&#039;ve got testimonials, whether they&#039;ve got an MBA, whether they&#039;ve got a suit or a fancy Instagram or whatever.

I&#039;m here today to tell you that it&#039;s not about any of that. It&#039;s about the market&#039;s needs, wants and desires and it&#039;s about solving the myth, it&#039;s about getting someone from their current situation to their desired situation. Here&#039;s this diagram which I use a lot because it&#039;s very simple, very basic and it really allows ... It brings clarity to the whole topic.

Someone has their current situation in the current self and then they have their desired situation and their desired self. A consultant is an expert at solving a particular problem in helping somebody make a particular transformation in their life or business. Your market doesn&#039;t care about what you have. Here&#039;s a wake-up call. Your market doesn&#039;t hear about what fancy process you&#039;ve got.

They don&#039;t care about whether you use Lean Six Sigma or whether you&#039;ve got or have an MBA or doctorate in law, they don&#039;t care about that. They don&#039;t care about what software you&#039;ve got on your computer, they don&#039;t care about how many hours you&#039;re going to spend, they don&#039;t care about any of that stuff. Zero. All they care about his getting to their desired situation. That&#039;s it.

A good message communicates this and resonates with the market to get their attention. A good message says to people, I understand your pains, I understand you as a person, I understand your market, I understand what you&#039;re going through, I know what it&#039;s like and I can help you get to where you want to go. I know the future that you want for your life or yourself, your family, your business. I know it down to every little point.

A really good message, it understands what the market wants, either then they do themself. That&#039;s a real good message, that&#039;s when you&#039;re really resonating but a good message communicates this and it resonates with the market to get their attention. We&#039;ve covered the theory. You know what a marketing message is, you know how you communicate your offer to your niche market and it&#039;s how you really get those, it&#039;s how you get in front of that niche market and it&#039;s how you things start happening.

Let&#039;s start putting this into action. Let&#039;s start taking some action and completing some worksheets and actually starting to craft your message. We&#039;re going to go over a couple of questions. First of all, what problems does your market have? When you did your market research and completed your worksheets such as your niche, definition worksheet and your ideal client avatar.

You would&#039;ve identified the problems, pains and desires that they have. You will have that from your completed worksheets and in those worksheets, you will have identified what keeps your ideal client awake at night, sick with worry, what is their thing that is just donning on them all the time? What is that thing that they&#039;re just dragging around like it&#039;s like a ball and chained just shackled to their ankle. They&#039;re pulling it around everywhere.

It&#039;s invisible to everyone else but they know what it is and when you have a good message, you know what that is too. Write a list of the problems that they have. When you&#039;ve completed these worksheets, you should have answered these questions and now select the most painful problem from the list.

Now, can you help them solve this problem? Don&#039;t worry about completing these questions here because I know you will have completed these in the worksheets but I&#039;m just bringing these back up again to bring them top of mind so we can have a good discussion in this module.

Can you help solve this problem for your ideal client? If you can, congratulations. You no longer sell processes, hours and deliverables. You now sell a solution to your market&#039;s most painful problem. You went from being a nobody or you went from being a monkey see, monkey do imitator in the market which they have the effectiveness of a mosquito. Market participants don&#039;t want to hear from people who just imitate everyone else. It&#039;s like they just get swatted away.

They&#039;re like an annoying pesky mosquito. However, when you really get a message that resonates, when you understand your market, their current situation, their desired situation, you know what they want, then you no longer sell processes and you&#039;re no longer a nobody or mosquito but you go to being a godsend because when you can help someone get to where they want to go, you&#039;re everything to that person.

You&#039;re like that person&#039;s savior. I&#039;m not exaggerating at all. This is what business is like. I think a lot of people think that you get into business and you don&#039;t really help anyone, you provide any value but money is a tight, money is tied to value. In this world and in this economy, if you want to make a ton of money, then you have to provide a ton of value. There is no other way to to do it. That&#039;s how it&#039;s done.

The reason why Google makes so much money is because Google provides a lot of value. How many people Google things each day? Apple makes a lot of money because they provide the awesome phones and computers and everything. Companies and people that make a lot of money provide a lot of value and the best way to provide a lot of value is to solve a really painful problem and you go from being just a me to sort of monkey see, monkey do, mosquito-like person to being a total Godsend when you do this and you make the transition from selling raw materials or processes to telling the solution and desired future.

Another good exercise to do is to define the cost of having the problem. What does it cost this person or business to have this problem? Start by defining it financially, define it emotionally. A really good message ties the emotional side and the financial side together. Weak messages only cover financial stuff. They say, &quot;Oh, it&#039;s just about making money or it&#039;s just about getting clients.&quot; Or they just talk about the emotions.

How would you like to be really happy and and have a really nice time? A really strong message brings them both together. It&#039;s like twines these things together. You&#039;ve got the financial side and the emotional side because to everyone, both are important. There are spiritual people who I&#039;m sure they&#039;ll tell you that it&#039;s very hard to be happy and live by how they think life should be lived when you don&#039;t have any money.

There&#039;s financial people who will tell you that it doesn&#039;t matter how much money you have, you&#039;re totally miserable if you&#039;re not happy, if you don&#039;t have your emotional sides covered too. Both are as importantly as each other and a really powerful message brings them both together.

Now you want to define what this problem could ultimately leads to if left unresolved. What&#039;s the worst case if they don&#039;t fix it? I know you would have completed these in the worksheets we&#039;ve done but I&#039;m just bringing them back up again to get them top of mind because I&#039;m going to show you how we&#039;re going to work with this in just a minute.

What&#039;s it worth to have this problem solved? What does this person stands to gain financially if they solve this problem? If they get this fixed, finance-wise, what&#039;s in it for them? What does this person stand to gain emotionally? How&#039;s their life going to improve? Their relationship with their wife or their girlfriend or their relationship with their body and their health? How good can things get for this person if they solve this problem? If we do solve this and we get them to their desired situation, how awesome can things really get?

You really want to paint the picture of how life could be so good that the person can literally taste it in a spit as they hear those words. That&#039;s a powerful message. Now, remember the consulting equation. We covered it in one of the earlier videos in week one and the video was called natural law and the consulting equation. Well, it looks like this. You&#039;ve got your niche times you offer equals your result. We pick our niche then find out what result they want by figuring out what did desired situation is.

We know these two sides, we know these two constants, the niche and the result. Now, it&#039;s up to us to figure out what offer keys with the niche to get the result, that&#039;s what we do as a consultant, we go through our iterative scientific method to figure out the right offer and then boom, we&#039;ve got it and we&#039;re making money and we&#039;ve got a business.

When it comes to creating a message, a really good message, I have a process just as predictable, just as precise as the consulting equation so we simply take the variables from the consulting equation and plug them into something that I call the message equation. Here&#039;s the message equation. It looks like this.

I help blank to blank by blank so I help blank to blank by blank. Now, these three blanks are places which we put different variables from the consulting equation into. It looks like this. I help niche to get result by offer. Very simple so it could be like this. I help accountants to get more customers by doing Facebook ads and funnels or I help yoga instructors to get more customers by Instagram marketing or I help young woman with binge eating issues to get rid of ... become free of their binge eating habits by going through a proven five-week process.

I help niche to get result by offer and we have your consulting equation already constructed because you will have done the other training modules in week one. You will have completed the worksheets and you already have this. You know what your niche is, you know what the result they want is and you know what the offer is. Now, we simply just plug them in here, you plug in your niche, you plug in the result they want and then you say buy this thing.

This is the formula for a very powerful message because remember, all people care about is themselves and getting their desired situation. That is literally what every human being on the face of the earth desires. They desire their future dream. People have dreams, aspirations, desires so I help this niche to get their result by this thing. This is how you construct a powerful message. It&#039;s very simple, it&#039;s profoundly simple and it really cuts right to the point.

It&#039;ll allows you to strike a nerve with the market. Let&#039;s craft your message right now and we&#039;ve got some worksheets to complete. By the time you get to this part of this video, I am really hoping that you listen to me at all the different times that I said, make sure you do the videos, watch them one by one in a sequential process and do the work, complete the worksheets, otherwise, none of this is going to make sense. I mean it, I meant it then, I mean it now.

If you haven&#039;t done that, go back and do it because you need to have done all of these different worksheets to complete this next worksheet we&#039;re going to talk about. At this stage, you should have done your niche definition worksheet which was on a previous lesson, the ten smart market diagnosis questions, the ideal client avatar worksheet, the minimum viable offer worksheet and the niche offer result hypothesis.

Now, this is a total of five worksheets, you should have done them all. You should have completed them and you should have them handy on your computer or printed out next to you right now so that we can create this next worksheet which is called the message hypothesis worksheet. Let&#039;s pull the message hypothesis worksheet up on the screen right now.

This is available for download below this video in the resources section and it is a PDF and what you can do is you can download it to your computer and you can print it out and complete it with pen and paper or you can just click this link here to be taken to the Google Doc and you complete the ... and you can complete it using Google Docs, the digital online version, totally up to you.

Part one, pre market of the message hypothesis worksheet. Some of the stuff is going be repetitive of from the other worksheet. That&#039;s fine. You can just copy this over. The reason why I keep asking these questions is so we have reference to it on each worksheet and also, you can never write this stuff down too many times like what is my niche? What is their current situation? What is the desired situation like this is all they really, all that exists in business.

You can&#039;t understand this enough. There is no such thing as understanding your niche in their current situation and their desired situation too much. The more I get you to start repeating this, the more I start drumming this in to your brain, the better it is for you because you&#039;re going to really start to think like them. They&#039;re going to be on your mind all the time and you&#039;re going to be much more comfortable speaking with them and dealing with them.

That&#039;s why I keep getting you to do it. What is your niche? Write it down. What is their current situation? Write it down. What is the desired situation? Write it down then what version and number is this hypothesis? If this is the first time you&#039;re doing this worksheet, you write number one, however, like the other niche offer result hypothesis worksheet, these are made to be never ending.

We come up with the first version of your message hypothesis which is what message we think is going to work, what message we think is going to resonate with your market and then we go to the market and we test it and we see if it does. We collect feedback and then we iterate and improve it because in business, there&#039;s no such thing as really finishing something completely like I think a lot of people believe that you create an offer, you create a message and then you forget about it and that&#039;s it.

Well, you can forget about it for like a little bit but really if you treat things that way in business, someone else comes along and does something better than you and business is really a never ending process. You&#039;ve got to get into that mindset. I remember too when I went to college and by the time you were done with the paper, you were done with it.

By the time you&#039;re done with a level, what university you like, if you did, one, you were done with it, by the time you did your degree, you were done. All right, you could forget about it but business is not the same. Business is the real world and I learned that. I was like, &quot;Oh well, we&#039;re never really done with these things, they&#039;re constant and continual ongoing processes where we keep improving things.&quot;

Even though we&#039;re going to come up with your message hypothesis now, if you want to be savagely effective in your market, you want to continuously keep improving your hypothesis, keep improving your message to get it razor sharp to the point where all your market can do is think about you.

What does this niche have or does this niche have their own language/slang and if so, what are some of the keywords and phrases and statements that they use? We want to understand does this niche have their own language? Like builders and plumbers use a lot of slang and I&#039;m sure all sorts of different niches use different slang.

For example in the online marketing and digital marketing, people use funnels and clicks. There&#039;s all sorts of words. After you&#039;ve done your research and your market like write down what their language is like, what are some of the keywords or phrases that they use? To create a good message, we really need to understand what language they use.

Now, number six, define your message in a simple sentence or two using the message equation which we talked about before and the equation is I help niche to get result by your offer. You want to write your message here, very simple, don&#039;t over complicate it. You just need to follow the formula. I help accountants to get more high value clients by Facebook ads and funnels. something simple like that. Do that.

Now, write your message or hypothesis. On a scale of one to ten for how well it resonates with your prospects before we go and get real life feedback from the market. Based on completing these questions above, doing your research and defining your I help blank to blank by blank statement here, how confident are you with this message? How well do you think it&#039;s going to resonate with your market based on what you know?

I want you to give it a rating out of one to ten and ten is being crystal clear and one is being not very clear at all, mostly noisy and you can get a grading here. Now, each time we iterate and improve your message, we&#039;re going to see how this improves, your confidence in your message because you&#039;re going to start off probably not having the highest rating on your message hypothesis.

That&#039;s totally fine. No one does. When I got started in business, mine was like a one. If I could have selected zero on this scale, I would have selected zero and is important for me to tell you that people, no one starts really confident, no one starts with an awesome badass message like &quot;Me, myself and everyone I know started with a message that quite honestly it sucked.&quot; It didn&#039;t resonate with the market and everyone&#039;s the same but the thing is is that you have to start with something.

You have to write down your message, there&#039;s no such thing as a wrong one and then we go test it with the market and we iterate it and we improve it. If I started with a message that was a one out of ten, only really like four, five years ago, now I&#039;ve made more than $20 million, make more of a hundred grand a day now. It doesn&#039;t matter.

All of my millionaire students they started with a message that wasn&#039;t awesome too, same with the six figure ones, everyone. Don&#039;t worry. If you think that your message isn&#039;t awesome right now because it probably won&#039;t be and the only way to get in or some messages to go to the market, see how they react to it, collect feedback and iterate it and improve it.

That&#039;s part one of the message hypothesis worksheet and part one is pre market. Pre market means we come up with this before we actually go to the market. Part two is live market feedback. I&#039;m gonna walk you through this part now, even though you won&#039;t be to complete this part until you&#039;ve actually gone out to the market and you&#039;ve started making contact with them and you&#039;re most welcome to start making contact with you market right now in week one. You can totally do that, however, most a lot of people are probably going to want to wait until when we do the mindset training in week two and then we do the sales training in week three.

If you wanted to wait until week three, that&#039;s totally fine as well. What you&#039;re going to do is you&#039;re going to start going out to your market and you&#039;re going to start generating strategy sessions with them and doing strategy sessions and each time you do a strategy session, you&#039;re going to check off each one so you do the first one, your second one, your third one, so on and so forth.

Now, it&#039;s really important that you should do at least 20 to 30 offers, 20 to 30 strategy sessions where you pitched your client before you judge your message hypothesis because a lot of people go out there and they form a message and they think, &quot;Okay, I&#039;m going to go out and test.&quot; Then they do one call and the person says no and then they&#039;re like, they run home, get under the [inaudible 00:44:26] and cry.

If you go and you do one of anything, I&#039;m not surprised it doesn&#039;t work. Even today, me with my thorough understanding of consulting and my massive collection of results and everything and I know this stuff through and through. I created all of this stuff. I invented it all and even now with my knowledge and understanding of all of this, if I went out and made an offer to someone, most of the time I&#039;d get a no because I get more nos than yeses but my conversion rate is probably around 30% on a real good day, it&#039;s up at 40% so that means that if I talked to ten people, only three would buy and seven would say no to me.

There&#039;s a high chance that seven in a row could say no. Seven people could tell me no in a row and I still wouldn&#039;t care because I&#039;m like, &quot;This happens.&quot; I know how numbers work. You can get seven no&#039;s in a row and then get three yeses in a row. I&#039;ve had sometimes where I&#039;ve gone at 15 no&#039;s in a row and then I&#039;ve had like almost nine yeses in a row.

Numbers have a funny way of sorting themselves out. It&#039;s like regression to the main, there&#039;s a whole bunch of complicated stuff. We don&#039;t even need to get into it. It&#039;s not worth knowing but you basic ... the basic takeaway of it is that numbers aren&#039;t evenly distributed across the dataset.

If you&#039;re out, I think a lot of people think that they should have a ... If they have a 30% conversion rate, then that means that one in every three people is going to say yes and then they go and do three, no one says yes so they&#039;re like, &quot;Oh my God, my conversation rate is zero percent. That&#039;s not true.&quot; You have to do a large enough number to get an accurate idea of your conversation rate.

You also have to do a large enough number of ... you have to do a large enough of number strategy sessions and pitches before you can really judge your message and I recommend that numbers 20 to 30 so you should go about making your offers to people and at the point where you&#039;ve made in between 20 and 30 offers, then you want to come back and make some refinements to your message hypothesis and come up with a new hypothesis and go out and test that and you want to keep going again and again and you want to keep sharpening this message and you want to get it to that point where it&#039;s really resonating and it&#039;s really shaking people.

It&#039;s important that I tell you that you don&#039;t need to do like multiple iterations before you start making money. You can start making money and you can get clients on your first message hypothesis. I&#039;m just saying that most people I&#039;m guessing are going to want to keep improving, most people if they get one client then they&#039;re going to want more. Like I said, I didn&#039;t create this training to just show you how to get one client.

I created this training to make you rich and create profound change because I don&#039;t think that ... one client is cool and everything. You&#039;d be like, &quot;Oh, I got my money back from this course and everything but I didn&#039;t put this much effort of my life into this training just to help you get a client. I want people to make six figures, seven figures. I want people to live their dreams and in order to do that, you&#039;re going to get multiple clients in an order to really crush it, you&#039;re going to want to keep improving upon your message.

That&#039;s why we get you to do this and then what words or phrases do you hear your prospects repeating over and over again? This is a good question. When you&#039;re doing your sales calls, I&#039;m going to get you to record them all and I&#039;m going to teach you the hands down, the most powerful and potent sales script that exists on the planet today for selling consulting services.

I know because the best salespeople in the world have said, &quot;This thing is intense.&quot; I&#039;m going to teach you that in week three and this thing is going to turn you into a beast when it comes to sales. One thing I get you to do is to record your sales calls so that we can go back and listen to them and see how you went and all of that stuff.

Well, when you&#039;re doing your sales calls and your strategy sessions and when you&#039;re listening to your recordings and stuff, you want to think what words or phrases do you hear people say over and over again. People saying the same words and phrases across all different calls. If they are, write them down, these are patterns starting to emerge.

What stories do your prospects like to tell that seem to recur across multiple calls? Are your prospects telling stories like saying things a rule, a particular way or they&#039;re complaining about a thing or do they would like to tell story about a particular job or dealing with a particular or supplier or something. What stories do they tell? Write them down.

This is a powerful one. What metaphors or analogies do your prospects use? Metaphors are really powerful and sometimes people within a particular niche they share metaphors and analogies to communicate with each other or sometimes to describe someone&#039;s own situation, they refer to a metaphor because it does so clearly.

When people do stuff like that, you want to really pay attention because the people that pick up on these things, they understand their market on a whole another level and the other people that are able to create really nerve-striking, arm hair-raising offers and messages so listen out for those and write them down.

What things does your prospect appear to be bored or saddened talking about? What topics if you bring them up or what words if you say them, what things dull down the conversation like what things make people who sounds sad? The life kind of drops out of the conversation like what are those things? Write them down and then on the opposite side, what things does your prospect appear to be excited and energized talking about?

Are there different words, phrases, or topics or things that if you talk about them, it&#039;s like the prospects that&#039;s up in these chairs, it&#039;s like back straight, all of a sudden, their eyes are open, they&#039;re alert but you&#039;ve got them awake. There&#039;s words and phrases that get people to start doing things like that. You want pay attention, you want to write those down.

What words, sentences and phrases that you used did not resonate with your prospect? Was there anything that was pretty much just like useless like sometimes people will say something and the prospect doesn&#039;t even listen. Most of what most business owners say is noise and they&#039;re not even saying anything.

If it doesn&#039;t mean anything to the prospect, they don&#039;t hear it. It&#039;s real simple. What things that you say don&#039;t seem to have any effect or just don&#039;t even seem to get heard? You want to start writing them down because as we improve and as we iterate on our message hypothesis, we want to start cutting out the things that don&#039;t work. As we work on our sale script and the way we pitch our offer and our Facebook ads and things, we&#039;re going to come back to these worksheets and we&#039;re going to look at things and be like, &quot;Oh, this words are just no no&#039;s. We don&#039;t talk about these things because they do they&#039;re useless what they make people feel bad in our market so it&#039;s really important to start collecting this information.&quot;

What words or sentences or phrases did resonate with your prospects? On the opposite side, what things did you say that really got people&#039;s attention and to emphasize your key points when you were talking like when you&#039;re giving your message, when you&#039;re doing your strategy sessions, quite often when people are trying to make a point, they use metaphors and analogies so just like we&#039;re keeping a record of your prospects metaphors and analogies that he or she uses we want to start writing down and keeping record of the metaphors and analogies that you use yourself.

What you want to do is write your message hypothesis on a scale of 1 to 10 for how well it resonated with your prospects after feedback. One being no resonance, ten being crystal clear resonant. We got you to rate your message hypothesis on a scale of one to ten and that the pre market section which is how well you think it&#039;s going to go and then what we do is we compare your pre market rating with your post market rating and we can see.

Your post market rating is then something which you can take and improve upon again and it&#039;s just a constant process of creating a hypothesis, going to the market and testing it, coming back with feedback, coming up with a new hypothesis, going back to the market testing it, it&#039;s a process.

We keep making a hypothesis. We keep going to the market we keep testing it and we&#039;re getting clients, we&#039;re making money at the same time but we keep sharpening up that sword because if we ... most businesses they get their message until it&#039;s good enough and then they go sell and they forget about their message and then they end up forgetting or their message ends up wearing off overtime and then all of a sudden they&#039;re like, &quot;Oh my God, my message isn&#039;t working anymore.&quot;

That&#039;s the bad way to do business. It&#039;s better to continuously sharpen it even when it doesn&#039;t need sharpening because that way you&#039;re so far ahead of every other person in your market that it&#039;s like people can&#039;t ever catch up. You want to be so far heat of your competitors, this is this is the hungry side of me talking, you don&#039;t have to be like this but I like to be at least, at the very least like ten times ahead of my competitors because if I&#039;m not, I&#039;m like, &quot;Well damn, this is not a big enough lead. I want to be ten times, this year I want to get way more times ahead.

To do that, you want to continuously keep sharpening that message can keep forming new hypothesis, keep testing. Now, based on the above, state ways in which you can improve your niche offer result hypothesis. This should say your message hypothesis so fix that one up. Based on this, how can you improve it? Write it down and how can we make our message stronger, more potent, more powerful and then after making at least 20 to 30 offers during at least 20 to 30 strategy sessions to your niche using your message hypothesis, collect the feedback in this form and then come up with ideas for improvement and then repeat it again.

Once you&#039;ve done this and you&#039;ve done 20 to 30 calls, you go back to the beginning and then you fill out this form again and this time you change it to version number two. This is version number two and then we go out and we test it again. We collect feedback and we go create version number three. We test it again, we get feedback version number four and I&#039;m pretty sure you understand me now like it&#039;s an ongoing process and the beauty of doing it in this ongoing way is that you just keep getting better and you keep getting better and you&#039;ll be ... honestly, you&#039;ll be surprised at how good you get in a very short amount of time, because most business owners don&#039;t think like this.

Most business owners don&#039;t even plan, most business owners don&#039;t have a hypothesis. You say hypothesis to most business owners, they&#039;ll be like, &quot;What are you talking about?&quot; This is the difference. I&#039;m teaching you how to behave and do business like a billionaire. This is next level business training.

Most people don&#039;t do stuff like this. Most people don&#039;t plan, most people test, most people don&#039;t measure. We&#039;re different and that&#039;s why we&#039;re going to get results like no one else does. That&#039;s your message hypothesis worksheet and what you want to do is complete that right now. Pause this video, take the time to complete it and obviously you&#039;re only going to be able to complete part one which is the pre market, the pre market stuff.

You&#039;re not going to be able to complete part two yet which is the life market feedback until you actually start making sales. You&#039;re most welcome to make sales right now, go for it if you want to. However, a lot of people are going to want to do the mindset training first and then get the sales training before they do that in weeks two and three.

Now, and I&#039;m sounding like a robot and I&#039;m repeating this a lot but it&#039;s so important that I tell you that this is an iterative process because I think a lot of people get ... I don&#039;t think I know because I&#039;ve had more than ten and a half thousand students in this program now and I&#039;ve been doing consulting for like five, six years now.

I know, they&#039;re not even thinking. I know that a lot of people come into business and they think that whatever they come up with on their first attempt is that they think that if that doesn&#039;t work, they&#039;ve failed and they think that it should work or else it fails. It&#039;s the wrong way to think.

There&#039;s flawed thinking. I know society stores that thinking into us but it&#039;s wrong. Proper businessman think I&#039;m going to form a hypothesis. This is a guess at what I think the market wants. They go out there and they test it. If people will say no, they don&#039;t care. They&#039;re like, &quot;That&#039;s feedback.&quot; They ask people, &quot;Why?&quot; They find out why and then they come back to the drawing board and they improve it. They change to a new hypothesis and then they go out and they test that again.

Nothing is a failure in this training. It&#039;s only feedback. If we get a yes, awesome. We get a client, we make money but if we get a no, it&#039;s okay. It&#039;s feedback, not failure. We need feedback to improve our process, our offer, our message, everything. We conduct our research, form a hypothesis and then go out to the market to test our hypotheses and collect feedback.

We use our message equation to iterate and improve again and again. Here&#039;s our message formula or a message equation again. We&#039;ve got our niche on the left. Then our message in the middle and it comes into contact with a niche and then we&#039;ve got our result which is on the right hand side.

Remember that market to message resonance is when you&#039;d tune your message to get on the same wavelength as your market niche. You&#039;ve got on the right hand side, you&#039;ve got you, the observer and you&#039;ve got your offer and then on the left hand side, you&#039;ve got your market niche, you&#039;ve got two antennas, just imagine that your market niche is on a one wavelength but the red line that you can see, the red squiggly line you can see.

Then you&#039;ve got you and your messages this blue or purple wiggly line. Now, when those waves match and they start resonating together, that is when you&#039;ve got your message right. That is when all your market can do is think about you, dream about you. All they&#039;re doing is seeing you everywhere, they&#039;re talking about you, it&#039;s like, &quot;Man, where did this guy come from? He&#039;s just everywhere.&quot;

that&#039;s when you&#039;ve got my market message resonance. That&#039;s where you&#039;re vibrating and you&#039;re on their wavelength so much that there&#039;s just no escaping you. This process helps you achieve and it&#039;s important that you understand that you don&#039;t just get this on your first go. You get it by forming a hypothesis going to the market, testing, iterating and improving and that&#039;s why we have a process for doing this.

Here&#039;s a print out. Here&#039;s a pin up that you can put up on your wall and we talked about this earlier in the video that&#039;s very important. Most businesses are shouting but all the market hears is noise. A volume without signal only frustrates people and hurts the ears. Instead of shouting, listen for feedback.

Tune your message till it resonates deep into your market&#039;s bone. This is an important thing to remember because you don&#039;t want to be that person that says, &quot;My niche sucks, my niche doesn&#039;t have any money. My niche can&#039;t afford anything. My niche is stupid. My niche won&#039;t listen. My niche is anything. I hear people say this all the time.

It&#039;s never their fault, it&#039;s always their niche. Seriously, in every niche there is in the world pretty much, people are making a lot of money. They have just understood the niche better than you and they&#039;re on a different wavelength than you. It&#039;s like they&#039;re communicating to the niche, they&#039;re selling things to the niche, everything is going well for them but when you&#039;re on a different wavelength, it&#039;s like no one can hear you anyway.

There&#039;s a lot of business owners and entrepreneurs out there that&#039;s just shouting, making a lot of noise but nothing&#039;s resonating and that&#039;s an important thing to remember because you ... just because you&#039;re saying stuff, you don&#039;t want to think that your market can hear you because if you&#039;re saying the wrong thing, then your market can&#039;t even hear the words you&#039;re saying because people have a filtered hearing system.

My people only are listening for certain things. If they don&#039;t hear things that relate to their life and their situation and their desires, that pretty much just goes in one ear out the other but when you strike on those nerves, when you get things that they care about, when you use the language that they use and when you craft your message properly the way I&#039;ve shown you in this module, it will resonate.

It will start to get them sitting up in their chair, start to get the hairs on their arms raising up and you&#039;ll have their attention. That&#039;s a good message. It&#039;s important to tell you that there is no message in the entire world that was awesome on the first attempt. It takes iterations and improvements to achieve mastery. Remember that.

I can really guarantee this to you. I can guarantee you that armed with this training alone, you are at the absolute forefront of your market and you&#039;re going to crush the competition. This training which I&#039;ve put together for you here, it is something else. It is worlds apart from anything else that&#039;s out there in the marketplace right now.

You&#039;re very lucky to be in this training and you&#039;re very lucky to be paying attention in watching these videos. If you complete these exercises, you&#039;re going to just run lapse around the competition and there&#039;s no exaggeration at all. I know a business owners, I know a lot of them and a lot of them do pretty good too and they&#039;re still ... they don&#039;t think like this. They don&#039;t take the time to craft the message like this and if you do this stuff, if you put this into action if you do this work, you&#039;re in for some awesome experiences as an entrepreneur and as a business owner because this stuff is on another level.

Here&#039;s what what everybody else is saying. Here&#039;s why when you follow this process, your message is going to be so powerful compared to everybody else&#039;s and this is what everyone is saying. They&#039;re saying I am, I am a consultant that helps accountants get more clients like I am. Well, they say I do, they&#039;re like, &quot;I do digital marketing for accountants. I do digital marketing for lawyers or I do Facebook funnels. I do you executive training for CEOs.&quot;

They say, &quot;I own. I own a very, very big awesome consulting business.&quot; or &quot;I own a consulting business that helps these people.&quot; They say we are. Now, these are all words that come from ego. They come from the ego. They come from you and someone talking about themselves and whenever you use these words I am, I do, I own, we are, they&#039;re bad because you don&#039;t remember, your market doesn&#039;t care about you or your market cares about is themself and all you should care about is your market because if you do that, if you become market obsessed instead of self-obsessed, you will make serious amounts of money because most people out there these days, they&#039;re too worried about their Instagram account, they&#039;re too worried about how their website looks.

They&#039;re getting fancy photos with photographers and wearing all of these different clothes and it&#039;s all about them. That&#039;s pretty selfish and it&#039;s not that I don&#039;t want you doing that, it&#039;s just that that doesn&#039;t work and I&#039;m here to teach you guys how to get results. If that worked, believe me, I&#039;d be presenting it in these videos. I&#039;d say we need to be doing this, we need to get out, we need to hire a photographer, we need to get this fancy suit, we need to get this pocket square going on, we need to get this fancy haircut, believe me I&#039;d be teaching how to do it if it worked but it doesn&#039;t work because no one cares about you.

All they care about is themself and we want to become market obsessed instead of self-obsessed and this is why most people&#039;s messages suck and it&#039;s not about you, it&#039;s all about the market and that&#039;s why when we create our message, it&#039;s I help blank to blank by blank. It&#039;s I help accountants to get their dream and their desire and their desired situation by doing this process.

When we use that formula, it&#039;s all about them and it&#039;s not about us and it cuts through the noise. It really resonates, gets on the same wavelength as our market is on and it helps us get clients. That&#039;s it for this training video on how resonating your message, how to craft your message and really tune it, fine tune it to resonate on the same wavelength as you market.

What I want you to do is I want you to complete that worksheet, you&#039;re only going to be able to do part one, you won&#039;t be able to do part two now unless you&#039;re one of those people that&#039;s hungry and starts making ... starts going pitching ... right now, if you want to, by all means go and do that but for most people, you&#039;re not going to be able to complete part two until you stop pitching stuff in week three.

That&#039;s it for this video. Thanks for watching. Please make sure you go and watch all the videos in full, please make sure you complete all of the worksheets and then go to the action items section which is below this and what I want you to do is I want you to upload and submit your action items so each week you have to submit your action items. It&#039;s a really good thing to do so you&#039;ve got everything stored safely in one place.

If you lose your laptop, if your computer breaks, if anything happens, you&#039;re going to have all of your information uploaded and stored safely and securely in one place and that&#039;s what our action items system allows you to do, it also allows you to tick off your progress throughout this program so that you can track your progress and everything. Very important to do that, go to the action items section, answer those questions, check off all of those items, upload your worksheets and then let&#039;s get week one signed off from you.

Let&#039;s go and move in to week two where we&#039;re going to talk about mindset and we really going to get into some awesome things that I can&#039;t wait to see you all in week two and teach you this revolutionary new way of thinking and seeing the world. Thanks everyone. I&#039;ll see you in the next training. Thanks.
