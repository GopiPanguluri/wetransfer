                        Hey, everyone. Sam Ovens here, and welcome to this training module called Minimum Viable Service Delivery. In this module, I&#039;m going to show you how to really refine your offer and how to really trim the fat off of it so that you&#039;re just delivering the most important thing to your clients. Don&#039;t get me wrong, this doesn&#039;t mean removing value from it. It&#039;s not that at all. It&#039;s removing everything that we don&#039;t really need so that we can just provide the pure value. That is what we call minimum viable service delivery, and that&#039;s what this training module&#039;s going to show you how to do, so let&#039;s jump right to it.


Here&#039;s what we&#039;re going to cover on today&#039;s training module. We&#039;re going to start off with what is minimum viable service delivery and why is it important? So I&#039;m going to explain it, explain the concept and everything, tell you why it&#039;s important. Then, we&#039;re going to dissect your offer and its service delivery components. We&#039;re really going to take your offer that already exists right now, and we&#039;re really going to dissect it and take it to pieces and look at, really, the individual components that make it up. Then, what we&#039;re going to do is we&#039;re going to find the 80/20 in what you do and then cut the fat from it. We&#039;re really going to find out what is the real value and what are just these other things that are distracting you from providing the real value. We&#039;re going to trim all of that fat off it.


Then, we&#039;re going to learn how to think like a billionaire with the first principles method. This is one of my secret weapons that I&#039;ve never taught anyone before, and I&#039;m going to be teaching it in this module. It&#039;s really going to help a lot of people. It&#039;s basically a new way of thinking. It&#039;s like most people reason by analogy, and I&#039;m going to show you how billionaires really think, how they construct their arguments, and how they decide what they&#039;re going to do. This is going to be very helpful for a lot of you. Then, we&#039;re going to discuss why less is more and the devastating power of focus. A lot of people, when it comes to their offer, they&#039;re just trying to put more stuff in a bag. They&#039;re just trying to provide more stuff to people. That&#039;s not the way to do it. Less is more, and when you really focus on the right things, it has insane power. That&#039;s what this module is going to cover, so let&#039;s get started.


Here&#039;s where you should be at this stage of the training program. Week one, you should have picked your niche and craft your offer and your message. We&#039;ve got that done. Then, in week two, it was all about mastering your mindset, setting goals, and working on your character, and we&#039;ve got that done. Then, in week three, we really learned how to become a killer salesman, and we learned how to adjust the script. We were practicing the script. You should have been partnering up with other people in the Facebook group and really practicing with each other. Practice makes a huge difference. Then, in week four, we learned how to market ourselves and our offers. We learned how to use both organic and paid methods. Then, we assembled our war machine, which is basically we set up our business. We got the ability to accept credit cards. We set up our website, our funnel, and all of that stuff. Then, we set a 30-day action plan, which was going to be the immediate 30 days after we had that stuff set up. We were going to hit the ground running and really take massive action in those first initial 30 days. We got that done.


Then, in week five, we discussed Facebook ads in extreme detail. We went right to the depths of Facebook, and we learned how to create your ads, how Facebook ads work, and really how to launch and manage a successful advertising campaign. Now, finally, in week six, we&#039;re going to be learning the secrets to managing your consulting business effectively. We&#039;ve basically showed you how to start it and then how to get clients and how to scale it up a little bit, but now we&#039;re going to be talking about managing it and refining it over time. That&#039;s what we&#039;re going to be doing this week.


First of all, what is minimum viable service delivery? Do you remember the crafting your MVO from week one of the training program? Back in week one, there was a module called crafting your MVO. Well, most people believe this is how you create a valuable consulting offer. Most people believe that an offer is just like a bag, and the value is just the stuff that they put inside the bag. That&#039;s basically what people think an offer is like. They try and just give people as much stuff as they possibly can, because they think that more stuff equals more value, but that is wrong. That is not the right way to do it. MVO stands for minimum viable offer. To quickly refresh your memory, this is how we come up with our minimum viable offer concept.


Really, if we boil it down, a consultant is someone who helps somebody go from their current situation to their desired situation. You&#039;ve got someone in their current situation with their problems and whatever life is like right now. Then, that person has some desires for the future, what they want to become, how they want to change things. There&#039;s this gap in the middle, and this gap brings about a lot of pain and a lot of frustration. A consultant is an expert at solving a particular problem and helping somebody make a particular transformation in their life or their business. A minimum viable offer is the least amount of things you can possibly do to help your niche bridge this gap.


So, what is minimum viable service delivery? Well, it&#039;s pretty much the same concept, only with service delivery. Here&#039;s what I mean. Before, we were just talking about minimum viable offer. That&#039;s back when we were just crafting our offer. Now, we&#039;re talking about service delivery, which means we&#039;ve actually got to deliver the services to our clients. We&#039;ve got to do the work. We&#039;ve got to work with them. Not only do we want to have a lean minimum viable offer, but we want to have a lean minimum viable service delivery, as well. We want to use the same thinking. We want to think of our service delivery as the bag, and we want to think of the things that we&#039;re providing in our service delivery as the stuff that&#039;s going in the bag. Most people believe that the more stuff that they put in the bag, then the more value that it&#039;s going to be, but that&#039;s not how it works.


Like I said, a consultant is an expert at solving a particular problem and helping somebody make a particular transformation in their life or business. Minimum viable service delivery is the least amount of things you can do to help your niche bridge this gap. Here&#039;s where most people go wrong. Most people start by offering something clean and focused, but they get pulled in different directions and end up offering a range of different things, because a client needed or they thought it would be good to add. Most businesses start out with very clear and clean and pure intentions. They&#039;re like, &quot;Oh, I see this problem this niche has. I&#039;m going to step in and become a provider of a solution to this problem,&quot; and everything&#039;s nice and clean and their business is running very nice and simple.


Then, different clients pull them in different directions, and they see all of these different opportunities. Their business becomes polluted, and their focus becomes totally distorted and thinned and spread out across all sorts of different things. Over time, these things accumulate, and before long, the service delivery has become extremely bloated, inefficient, and time consuming. The worst part about all of this is that the additives do not add any true value, and most of the time, they distract the consultant from providing the real value in the first place. What&#039;s so crazy is that most people, a client asks them to add something to their offer, so they do it this one time, and then it kind of creeps its way in. Then, before long, the consultant&#039;s offering it to everyone. Then, the consultant offers this new service, and they offer a few different things.


Then, before long, the consultant&#039;s trying to help their clients, and they think that by adding more things, they&#039;re helping their clients. What ends up happening is by adding too many things, they can&#039;t even deliver on anything. In an attempt to actually add more value, they actually add no value. That&#039;s what happens. After too many additives, the service has become so convoluted that it no longer solves the niche&#039;s problem and no longer bridges the gap between current situation and desired situation. Meaning the whole formula for consulting just disintegrates when you just keep adding things into the mix.


What&#039;s the solution? Well, we really want to dissect your offer and its service delivery components. We want to look at what it is you&#039;re offering, and we really want to take it to pieces, cut it up, and look at what&#039;s in there, what&#039;s involved. Because our offer and service delivery methods become so bloated over time, we must constantly analyze what we&#039;re doing and make sure that we&#039;re keeping the main thing the main thing. How do we do that? Well, I&#039;ve got something called the Offer Analysis Worksheet. This is basically a worksheet that allows you to dissect your offer and its different service delivery components. It&#039;s available in the resources section beneath this video for download, and it&#039;s a Microsoft Excel file. You can download it to your computer. Then, you can click the link at the top of it, and you&#039;ll be able to open it in Google Drive. I do recommend using Google Drive instead of Excel on your computer.


So here it is right here. I&#039;ve got it pulled up on my screen. I&#039;ll explain how this worksheet works. We&#039;ve got, down at the the bottom, these different tabs: problem analysis, problem benefit feature analysis, service delivery analysis, 80/20 offer refinement, and your new offer. Just bear with me, and I&#039;ll explain how this whole thing works. Don&#039;t jump ahead and jump into these different things, because this is a method and a process that I created that&#039;s made specifically to help you get the most powerful and most potent offer that you can possibly have. What we do is we put in our niche, first of all. You want to plug in here what your niche is. I&#039;ve just put plumbers here. I&#039;ve put an example in here for you so you understand how this works. Then, we want to put in our current situation, so the niche&#039;s current situation. I&#039;ve said here plumbers currently get clients through the Yellow Pages referrals and basically online advertising that targets all types of plumbing jobs. They get a mixture of jobs from online advertising, some that they don&#039;t want, and their offline advertising methods are declining in effectiveness.


Then, we&#039;ve got the desired situation, which is the situation where the niche wants to be. It&#039;s where they want to get to. Plumbers desire to have a more predictable flow of high-value clients from online advertising, specifically hot water cylinder repair jobs, since they are the most profitable. They want to have a trusted person to manage all of their digital marketing so that they can just forget about it and do what they&#039;re good at, which is plumbing jobs. Once we&#039;ve got the current situation designed and the desired situation defined, we want to think, well, what&#039;s the main blocker? What is stopping people from going from this current situation to this desired situation? I&#039;ve written here plumbers work on fixing pipes and water leaks, not digital marketing and technology. Plumbers don&#039;t have the skills or the time to start doing their own digital marketing, and they want to trust somebody else to do it for them. The problem is that they have tried different people, but they don&#039;t know what they&#039;re doing, and the results are average. Plumbers feel trapped in this place.


That&#039;s an example. You would put your current situation there, desired, and then the blocker. Then what we do is we start really breaking up the different problems that make up this overall problem. This is very high level. Current situation, desired situation, and the thing that&#039;s blocking them. Now, what we want to do is break that up. What individual, specific problems actually make up this overall high-level problem? Then, we just want to list out these different problems within it. I&#039;ve written one here. It says getting a mixture of job types. That&#039;s the name I&#039;ve given to the problem. You can see at the top, in these titles here, I&#039;ve described what each one is and how it works. If we hover over problem name, it says give the specific components of the overall problem a name. Then, problem explanation, explain the specific problem and provide a real-life example, if possible. Then, fix or prevent. Does this problem currently exist for the client? That would be fix. That means the client has the problem. Or does this problem potentially exist in the future for the client? Then, we would put prevent there. Now, in this case, this is current, so it&#039;s a fix problem, not a prevent.


Then, awareness level, so how aware of this problem is the client? A lot of the time, there&#039;s problems which we think people have, and they might have them, but they might not be aware of them, so it&#039;s really important that we understand our niche&#039;s awareness when it comes to these things. What we do is we grade each piece of the problem between one and five. I&#039;ve got here one, unaware of the problem/need; two, aware of the problem/need; three, aware of the problem and solution; four, aware of problem and product; or five, aware of everything. At stage one, someone would be totally unaware that they even have the problem, even if they did, and they don&#039;t even believe that this is a need. At stage two, they would understand that they have the problem, but they wouldn&#039;t know that there&#039;s any solution. They&#039;ve just got a sore back, but they don&#039;t know there&#039;s a solution to a sore back, for example.


Then, with level three, they&#039;re aware of the problem and the solution. They&#039;re aware that they have the sore back, and they&#039;re also aware of the fact that there are solutions for a sore back, but they don&#039;t know the specific solutions. The fourth level of awareness is when they&#039;re aware of the problem and the product. So that&#039;s one level higher in awareness. They&#039;ve got a sore back, they know that solutions to sore backs exist, and they know the specific products on the market that exist and how they can get them. So that&#039;s a very aware market. Then, five, that&#039;s just when they&#039;re aware of everything. They know the price, they know the features, they know how all the different products and features stack up against each other. That&#039;s a very well-developed market when they&#039;re aware of everything.


What we want to do is we want to break out our overall high-level problem here. We want to break it out into its different pieces. You want to just give it a name, something simple. Explain the problem. Is this is a problem that they have right now? Are we fixing it or preventing it? Assign it an awareness level, and then we give it a P score. It says here P score, which stands for problem score. Rank the specific problem in order of importance to the client, from one being most important to 10 being least important. Once you&#039;ve got all of your different problem components in here, rank them in order of importance from 1 to 10. One, most important; 10, least important. That&#039;s the first step of this process.


Now, the next step is to click on the problem feature benefit analysis tab down at the bottom. What you&#039;ll notice is that this pulls over from the previous one. You&#039;ll notice here, if I type the letter xx here, if I go here, you can see it adds these letters xx here. This worksheet is designed to pull information from the previous tab. That&#039;s why it&#039;s important that you work through it sequentially. Whatever problems you typed here, they will automatically appear here. You&#039;ve got your different problem names, whether they&#039;re fix or prevent, and you&#039;ve got their P score. Now what we need to do is assign specific features to each problem.


Up here in the instructions, it says describe the specific feature that is intended to solve this problem. Then, describe the specific benefit that your client will gain when the feature is applied to this problem. Then, finally, rank each specific problem feature benefit for its uniqueness and value, and then observe the F score, which is assigned to each item. Let me explain this to you. We&#039;ve got the different problems. Now what we&#039;re looking at is what features of our offer are really designed to solve each piece of this problem. In all products and all services, everything&#039;s really derived from a problem. People have problems. Then, we come up with features, which are different things, like it might be some feature in a software application. Well, that feature is designed to really help someone solve a particular problem. Then, when it&#039;s solved, then they experience benefits.


So we&#039;ve got problems, features, and benefits. A problem is a problem, a feature is a particular thing that we create in order to solve a problem, and the benefit is the real-life value somebody gets from something. Let me give you an example to make it really simple. A problem might be that mothers who have young children in Las Vegas, their children get sunburned by sitting in the car, because the sun is going through the glass and it&#039;s burning them. That&#039;s the problem. Then, a company might create a window-tinting film that cuts out 99% of UV rays, right? A feature of the window-tinting film would be that it cuts out 99% of UV rays. That&#039;s a feature. Then, the benefit, this is when you apply the feature to the problem. When you apply that 99% UV cutting film, that&#039;s the feature, when you apply that to the problem, which is children getting burned in the back of cars, well, now you&#039;ve got a benefit, which is children no longer getting burned in the back of cars. You can see how these things line up.


What we want to do is go through and really name the feature that we have in our offer that is specifically designed to solve each particular piece of the problem. If you don&#039;t have a particular feature to solve each piece of the problem, then it&#039;s totally fine. We&#039;re only writing here what you have. If you haven&#039;t crafted an offer, this isn&#039;t really going to work for you. You should already have an offer, and you should have already been out implementing it, got clients, and all of that stuff. This is a way to really help you refine the process and refine the offer.


I&#039;ve got here an example. For getting a mixture of job types, this is the problem. The feature that I&#039;ve got in my offer to solve it is specific job targeting. Instead of getting a mixture of jobs, we want to get very specific jobs. That&#039;s the feature. Then, the description of the feature. Well, what we do is we create ad campaigns to get specific jobs instead of just generic jobs. We&#039;ve got here the definition of the feature name and the feature description. Now, what is the benefit of applying this feature to this problem? Well, the plumbers get high-value jobs. Now, let&#039;s describe this benefit. They only get hot water cylinder repair jobs instead of just a mixture of jobs. So you see how these things line up? It might take you just a couple of minutes to get your head around it, but once it clicks for you, you&#039;ll totally see all of the stuff in a different way. Everything in business is just problems, features, benefits, and they line up like this.


Now, what you want to do is you want to list out all the different features and benefits you&#039;ve got created to solve these particular problems. Then what you want to do is give them some scores here. Uniqueness. You want to rank the specific problem and feature and benefit on how unique it is compared to the other market offerings. One is extremely unique to 10 is not unique at all. For each specific feature and benefit you&#039;ve got, how unique is it compared to what your competitors are offering out there in the marketplace? One is that no one&#039;s offering it. It&#039;s a unicorn feature. 10 is everyone&#039;s offering it. Rank each one. Then, the second one is value. Rank the problem feature benefit based on how much value it provides to the client in their view. So this isn&#039;t in your view. This is in their view. One is it provides extreme value, and 10 is it pretty much provides no value at all. We&#039;re going to rank how much the client perceives that they&#039;re getting for each feature.


Then, we have F score. F score, which stands for feature score, provides the overall importance of an offer component based on problem, priority, uniqueness, and the value. What you can see here is this is a formula here. It&#039;ll automatically calculate. There&#039;s no need for you to actually enter this in. It automatically calculates. The higher the F score, then the more powerful this is, the more powerful this particular piece of your offer is. This is a really good formula, because we&#039;re taking into account the problem and how important the problem is, and we&#039;re taking into account uniqueness, because uniqueness is very important too, and the value. We&#039;re really looking at these three values. Then, we&#039;re generating a total score. Once you&#039;ve got all of your different features here and you&#039;ve got the descriptions, the benefits and everything, then this F score here will tell you how important it is, how important each component of your offer is. That&#039;s going to really help you understand what are the pieces of your offer that aren&#039;t providing much value and what are the pieces of your offer that are providing insane amounts of value.


No elements in an offer are equal. Sending reports to clients is nowhere near as valuable as just doing really good work for clients and getting them results. I mean, truthfully, if you got clients results, they wouldn&#039;t even want reports. You get my point. Not all the things you do for your clients in your offer and for your services are going to be equal in terms of the value and the uniqueness and the painfulness of the problem. This will really bring some clarity to that for you.


Then, once you&#039;re done with this, you can go to the third tab, which is called Service Delivery Analysis. On this tab, I&#039;ll read the instructions to you. You want to describe the service delivery required to fulfill on this particular feature and the persons required to fulfill it, the complexity of the task, and the time taken to complete the task. Once you&#039;ve entered that, observe the S score and the E score provided to you so that you can determine the efficiency of each service component. Now, this is pretty simple. Don&#039;t let the instructions or these different names of scores make you think this is confusing or complicated or anything.


First of all, it&#039;s going to pull all of your stuff from these previous tabs, so you don&#039;t have to retype everything. It&#039;s just going to bring it in here. Now what you want to do is you want to put in it your service delivery description. What this is is this is the task that you or somebody else must complete in order to fulfill the specific feature. I&#039;ve got here the feature name is called specific job targeting, and if the description of it is creating ad campaigns to get specific jobs, well, what do we actually have to do? That&#039;s just a feature. What does somebody have to do in our business? Well, someone has to set up the AdWords campaigns and the landing pages, et cetera. You want to describe the process. Then, who is in charge of this? It might be you or it might be a contractor or it might be somebody else. Write the person whose job it is to do each piece of this.


Now we&#039;ve got complexity, so how complex is this specific part of the service? You want to rank it out of 10. One is extremely simply, and 10 is extremely complex. If this is a really easy job for you or John Doe to do, then you&#039;d just give it a one, because it&#039;s so easy. If this is an absolute teeth-grinding, complicated piece of work to do, then you&#039;d give it a 10. Now, how much time? How much time does it take the person or persons to complete this part of the service? Rank it out of 10. One is little to no time, and 10 is extremely time-consuming. We want to know what are we actually doing for each feature? What&#039;s the actual work required? Who&#039;s doing it? How complex is it? How much time is it going to take? Then, we start to get a very good view of how involved it is to actually deliver each part of our service. Then, cost. How much does it cost to deliver the specific part of the service? Rank it out of 10. One is extremely cheap; 10 is extremely expensive. If it&#039;s free, you&#039;d just put one. If it&#039;s really costly because you have to pay a contractor a lot of money to do it, well, then it&#039;s probably going to be 10.


Then once you&#039;ve done that, S score and E score will automatically calculate for you based off these inputs you put in here. S score, which is your service score, provides the overall strain on your company to provide each part of the service. One is little to no strain, and 10 is extreme strain. How this works is if you&#039;ve got high complexity and you&#039;ve got a high amount of time and a high cost, then S score&#039;s going to be really high. If you&#039;ve got very low complexity, very low time, very low cost, then S score is going to be low. What this view allows you to do is look at all of the different features you have in your offer and then the actual work that goes into each feature, the person who&#039;s doing it, and then how complicated, time-consuming, and expensive each piece is. Typically, what consultants do is they look at the overall offer, and they don&#039;t really dissect it, and they don&#039;t cut it up and look at each piece like this. It&#039;s fascinating to really start doing this and look at each piece and see what&#039;s involved.


Then, E score, which automatically calculates for you. E score, which stands for efficiency score, provides the overall efficiency of providing each part of your service based on problem, importance, uniqueness, value, and the strain on your company to provide it. One is high efficiency, and 100 is low efficiency. E score takes into account everything we&#039;ve done in this whole sheet. It basically looks at all the way back from how important is the problem, how painful is each problem back here. Then it looks at how unique is the benefit that we&#039;re offering, how high is the value, and how valuable is the feature. Then it also looks at how complex and time-consuming and expensive is it for us to provide it. This gives us an overall score for everything.


Once you&#039;ve done this, once you&#039;ve listed out all of your different offer components, what you&#039;re left with in this column will absolutely bring clarity to your offer. You&#039;ll be able to see what is most important, what is least important. It will be fascinating for you to look at, because you&#039;ll probably see right away that some of the things that are trivial and not important at all are things that you&#039;re really prioritizing and trying to put all of your time into. Then, you&#039;ll probably notice that some of the things that are extremely important, you&#039;re kind of neglecting. This is a very interesting thing to do, because often what people do is they just work on the stuff that is complex, time-consuming, and expensive. They forget about the problem that it&#039;s being attached to, the uniqueness, the value. They forget about all of the stuff. Quite often, people end up prioritizing different pieces of the offer and the service for the wrong reasons.


That&#039;s why, every now and then, you want to use this Offer Analysis Worksheet, to really work through these three layers here from the problem to the feature and the benefit through to the actual service delivery and really drill down, dissect the offer, and see how things stack. Pretty much nobody views their offer in this way, and when you do, it&#039;ll help you trim the fat on the offer. It&#039;ll help you adjust it, innovate it, iterate it, change it so that you can really adapt it to be the most powerful offer in your market to help your clients. That is the Offer Analysis Worksheet.


So now that we&#039;ve analyzed your offer and its different components, it&#039;s time to apply 80/20 to it so that we can determine what&#039;s most important. This next section is called finding the 80/20 in what you do and then cutting the fat. Do you remember the 80/20 principle? We discussed it during week two&#039;s mindset training. Here&#039;s a quick refresher. The 80/20 principle says that in everything we do, 20% of the effort drives 80% of the results, and 80% of the effort drives 20% of the results. Really, our results come from these small, little inputs, and most of our time is wasted. Most of our efforts, most of our money, most of our energy, most of everything that we do is wasted. Only a very small amount of it is responsible for bringing most of the results.


Here&#039;s some examples of 80/20 in nature, just to refresh your memory on this. It&#039;s fascinating. We see this exponential distribution everywhere. 80% of the planet is water, and 20% of the planet is land. 80% of the land is in 20% of the countries. 80% of the sunshine is in 20% of the countries. 80% of the snow and rain is in 20% of the countries. 80% of the crime is committed by 20% of the people. 80% of health issues are experienced by 20% of the people. 80% of struggle and pain is experienced by 20% of the people. There&#039;s always this skewed distribution here. You can see even more examples. I&#039;m not going to bore you by reading through them all, because we covered this in detail back in the mindset training. Some examples, 80% of the Earth&#039;s population lives in 20% of the countries or 80% of car accidents happen on 20% of the roads. You get my point. There&#039;s this 80/20 distribution everywhere.


So how do we apply 80/20 to our offer? Well, we use the 80/20 offer refinement tab on the Offer Refinements Worksheet. I&#039;m going to go ahead and pull that up right now. It&#039;s the same worksheet we&#039;re working on, the Offer Analysis Worksheet. I&#039;m going to open this up. All we&#039;re doing is we&#039;re going to the next tab, which is called 80/20 offer refinement. Here&#039;s the instructions. Describe the consequences of removing this particular service component from your offer. What would happen? Would the removal of this service component be fatal to your offer working and serving your client? Finally, make a decision to remove the service component from your offer or not. What we&#039;re basically doing is we get to see the scores here. How important is the problem? How important is the feature? How efficient is the service? Overall, how important is each piece.


Once we can get an accurate view of how important each piece of our offer is, we should be able to start applying 80/20 to it. So we should be looking for the 20% of the things in our offer that are providing 80% of the value. If you had 10 things, two of them should be driving most of the value in your entire offer, and the rest of them are probably doing almost nothing. They&#039;re probably just trivial. What we want to do here is we want to write down, in this column here, what are the consequences of removing this particular piece of your offer or your service. Don&#039;t get too serious about it right now. Don&#039;t think that you&#039;re actually removing it. You&#039;re not. You&#039;re just writing down what the consequences would be.


It says here what are the consequences of removing the particular service component? If we were to take this particular piece out of our service, what would happen? What are the consequences? Describe them down here for each one. Once you&#039;ve done that, would removing this particular piece be fatal or non-fatal? What this means is would your offer still work for your client if you took this out? If we took this one piece out, would the whole thing just fail? Or if we took this thing out, would it be it would probably be okay? You want to write down here whether it would be fatal or non-fatal.


Then, finally, what we want to do is we want to make a decision if we&#039;re going to remove this piece from our offer or not. We just say yes or no. If we can see that something is really low value and it&#039;s pretty low efficiency in this E score here, if we can see it&#039;s really inefficient and we can see that the consequences of removal aren&#039;t that bad and it&#039;s not going to be fatal if we take it out, then we should definitely decide yes. We should be taking this thing out of our offer, because we don&#039;t want to have any fat in our offer. We want it to be as lean and as mean as possible. That means really high efficiency, and it&#039;s needed. It&#0#039;s mandatory. That&#039;s how we go through and we trim it. So you want to take your time to work through these different pieces of your offer and describe the consequences. Would it be fatal or non-fatal? Then make a decision to remove it or not.


What you&#039;re really using to do this is 80/20. Look at the E score and apply 80/20. What is the top 20% of the efficient pieces of your offer? Then, what&#039;s the bottom 80% of the things in your offer? You really want to start trimming from that 80%. You want to be able to remove a whole bunch of stuff from your offer. Like I said, most consultants, they get into business with a nice lean, clean, and focused offer, and over time, they get pulled in different directions by all of these different clients. They see these different things, and they&#039;re like, &quot;Oh yeah, I&#039;ll provide that,&quot; or, &quot;Oh, yeah, I&#039;ll provide that to my clients, too.&quot; Their whole business and their offer gets totally messed up over time. That&#039;s why we&#039;ve got this process here, so that you can really work through and drill down and then cut the fat from your offer. You want to do this process, really, every 90 days. You want to work through and make sure your offer is always being refined and it&#039;s always being cleaned up.


Then, once you&#039;re done with this particular tab here, the 80/20 offer refinement, you want to go to the next tab, which is your new offer. Here, all we&#039;re doing is we&#039;re removing the things that we don&#039;t want in our offer. For example, if I have 12 things here, I&#039;m going to cut it down to six. You just select the six at the bottom or you select the six that you&#039;re going to remove, and you just delete them. Don&#039;t worry, it&#039;s not going to delete them from the previous tabs. We&#039;re going to say are we going to remove it, yes or no? Whatever our decision is here, we&#039;re just going to go ahead and remove it here. Then, once we&#039;ve removed it, now you&#039;re looking at your new offer. This is your offer after all the fat&#039;s been trimmed off it.


Now, what you might start to do is you might think, well, this particular thing here, now that I&#039;m thinking about it, I might want to make a small adjustment or a refinement to this particular piece of my offer. Well, you can type in any adjustments or refinements you want to make here and any notes here. This final tab, called your new offer, this is going to show you what your offer is. This process is extremely powerful for really taking your offer, drilling it down, cutting the fat off it, and then crafting a new more honed and refined one. Like I said, this is a process you want to work through pretty much every 90 days or at least once a year, because your offer is going to get bloated over time. It&#039;s really going to lose its power. When you keep doing this process to it over and over and over again, what you&#039;ll find is your offer keeps getting better and better and better. This is a very powerful process to use for all consultants and coaches and service providers.


The next section is called learning to think like a billionaire with the first principles method. What is the first principles method? Well, most people reason by analogy. Then, a very rare, small group of people reason by first principles. It&#039;s pretty much like billionaires that use first principles, and then the rest of the world just uses analogy. I&#039;ll explain the two to you right now. We&#039;ll start with reasoning by analogy. Reasoning by analogy is when you solve an argument by relating it to a common saying, belief, trend, or the way it&#039;s being done now or has been done before or a particular example you can think of. This is how you reason. If you see an argument which is like, &quot;You should do this because of this,&quot; well, you&#039;re going to look at that argument and then you&#039;re going to use your reasoning mechanism in your brain. Most people&#039;s reasoning mechanism is, well, what is the common belief? What is everybody out there thinking and saying right now? What are other people doing, and what are some other examples I&#039;ve seen? It&#039;s basically just not even doing your own thinking. It&#039;s basically just defaulting to what everyone else is doing. That&#039;s reasoning by analogy.


Now, on the other side, there&#039;s reasoning by first principles. Reasoning by first principles is when you boil down an argument to its most fundamental truths and then build it up from there using deductive logic. Don&#039;t worry if this sounds a little bit confusing right now. I&#039;ve got some examples which I&#039;m going to show you that will really help bring clarity to this thing. When we reason by analogy, we&#039;re really not doing any of our own thinking. We&#039;re just comparing what we&#039;re deciding to what other people have done, so we&#039;re never really thinking for ourselves. When we&#039;re reasoning with first principles, we&#039;re really boiling the argument right down. We&#039;re not caring about what anyone else has said or what anyone else has done. We&#039;re just trying to really boil the argument down to the most fundamental truth in it and then start building up from there. Like I said, this is how billionaires think, and this is how pretty much everyone else in the world thinks. This is a very powerful method when you learn how to use it.


Here&#039;s some examples to help really cement your understanding. Example number one, using Snapchat for your business. We&#039;ll start with reasoning by analogy. The premise would be you should use Snapchat for your business because everybody is using it and it&#039;s the next best thing. That might be an argument that someone&#039;s making. You might hear someone say that. I&#039;m sure everyone&#039;s heard that. Now, the typical person will do their thinking like this. This is how they will reason. They&#039;ll reason by analogy. Well, Gary Vaynerchuk said to use Snapchat for your business, and Gary is using Snapchat for his business, and so is Kim Kardashian and all of my friends. Then, the conclusion. Therefore, I should use Snapchat for my business, right? That&#039;s how most people think. As shocking as that is, that&#039;s how they do it.


Now, here&#039;s the other way to do it, reasoning by first principles. So the premise is the same. You should use Snapchat for your business because everybody is using it and it&#039;s the next big thing. Well, here&#039;s some reasoning with first principles. Snapchat is a social media platform. Compared to Facebook ads, Snapchat doesn&#039;t provide as much results to businesses. I&#039;m a business and I want results. If I use Snapchat, then it will distract me from using Facebook ads, and that would decrease my results. Conclusion, therefore, I shouldn&#039;t use Snapchat for my business.


So you see the difference here. On one side, with the analogy, we just look at famous people and friends that are doing it. Then, on the other side, we boil it down and we really just look at it, not as who&#039;s using it, but we just boil it down to its most fundamental truth. Then we start building up from there. Well, if A is true, then B is true. If A and B are true, then C is true. That&#039;s kind of how we work up. This is really, really key to learn as a business owner. It&#039;ll help you make decisions with much more clarity.


Now, here&#039;s a second example. Is Donald trump a racist? Reasoning by analogy. The premise someone could say, &quot;Well, Donald Trump is a racist because he said a racist thing.&quot; Now, the reasoning. If we were reasoning by analogy, some would say, &quot;Well, Donald Trump said a racist thing. Everybody thinks and says he is a racist, and he even looks like a racist. Therefore, Donald Trump is a racist.&quot; That&#039;s reasoning by analogy. Then, reasoning by first principles. Well, the premise is the same, Donald Trump is a racist because he said a racist thing. Then, the reasoning. Well, Donald Trump said a racist thing. Everybody in the world has said a racist thing at one point in their life, but everyone in the world isn&#039;t a racist. Therefore, Donald Trump isn&#039;t a racist. You see the key difference here. We boil it down and we use if A is true, then B is true, and we kind of build up like that.


Now, I don&#039;t actually know if he is or isn&#039;t. I don&#039;t know him, never met him, so I can&#039;t say whether he actually is or isn&#039;t. What I do know is that if we&#039;re to assess the argument Donald Trump is a racist because he said a racist thing, if we&#039;re just purely to isolate that and really analyze that, using first principles, we get the exact opposite result. Most of the time in business, if you use the first principles method, you&#039;re going to get a different result to what everyone else thinks, and it&#039;s going to be a much more accurate one.


Now, here&#039;s a third example. Sam Ovens&#039; consulting program is a scam. Reasoning by analogy. The premise, Sam Ovens&#039; consulting program is a scam because you can find all of the information within it on the Internet and books and through trial and error. That&#039;s the premise. Then, the reasoning if we&#039;re reasoning by analogy. Well, I could learn everything in Sam Ovens&#039; consulting program by searching the Internet, reading books, and practicing with trial and error, and my friend said he was a scammer, too. Therefore, Sam Ovens&#039; program is a scam. Now, here&#039;s first principles. Premise, Sam Ovens&#039; consulting program is a scam because you can find all of the information within it on the Internet and in books and through trial and error. Reasoning, with first principles this time. Sam Ovens&#039; consulting program is made up of components that can be found elsewhere for cheap. An iPhone and house are made up of materials that can be found in the ground for cheap. iPhones and houses aren&#039;t scams, because the combination of materials provides value over combining them on your own. Sam Ovens&#039; program provides value over combining the components on your own. Therefore, Sam Ovens&#039; program isn&#039;t a scam. You see the difference in thinking here. One is a lot clearer and a lot cleaner than the other one.


Example number four. Now, this is where we really tie it into your offer. You might be thinking, why is Sam telling us about this first principles and reasoning by analogy thing? Well, it comes into your offer big time. Remember back here how we were looking at your offer and we were thinking which pieces are we going to cut out, which pieces are we going to leave in? Well, a lot of the time, people don&#039;t want to remove pieces from their offer because everyone else is doing them, so they might see all of these features here, and they&#039;re all very low value, low efficiency, but they don&#039;t think they can cut them out, because everyone else is doing them. Even despite being faced with the facts here, they&#039;ve got the facts in front of their face right here on the screen, they still can&#039;t bring themselves to act and decide and cut them out because of what everyone else thinks and because of what everyone else is doing.


So this is why we use this sort of thinking, we use the first principles method. So here&#039;s how it works, for example, with this, with your offer. Example number four, providing one-on-one calls and reports to clients. This is a big one, because most people think that they have to do all of this one-on-one time with their clients and send them all sorts of fancy reports and everything. Well, here&#039;s reasoning by analogy. The premise, you should provide one-on-one calls and reports to your clients, because that&#039;s the industry standard. The reasoning, well, every one of my competitors are providing one-on-one calls and reports to their clients, and this is how it&#039;s done. This is how it&#039;s always been done. Therefore, I should provide one-on-one calls and reports to my clients. That&#039;s how most people think.


So when they&#039;re looking at this sheet here and they can see that the one-on-one calls and reports are very inefficient and they&#039;re not really adding much value, they should really cut them out here. These things should be axed from your offer. Most people can&#039;t bring themselves to do it, because everyone else is doing it. This is where this thinking comes in. So here&#039;s reasoning by first principles. The premise, you should provide one-on-one calls and reports to your clients, because that&#039;s the industry standard. The same argument exists, but here&#039;s the difference in thinking. This is when we reason with first principles. The one thing that I&#039;m supposed to deliver to my clients is results. Results is more customers for them. One-on-one time and reports isn&#039;t more customers for them. Providing one-on-one calls and reports would distract me from providing more customers to them. Conclusion, therefore, I shouldn&#039;t provide one-on-one calls and reports to my clients, because one-on-one calls and reports isn&#039;t results, and all our clients want are results. If we do something else that isn&#039;t what they want, then it&#039;s going to take time away from us doing what they want.


Do you see the difference in thinking here? This is very powerful. You want to use this sort of thinking to analyze all the different components within your offer here and let these numbers speak to you. Don&#039;t just decide to leave something in because everyone else is doing it. If it doesn&#039;t make sense, if the numbers don&#039;t add up, cut it. Cut it out. By just focusing your energy on the small few things that actually provide value, your clients are just going to absolutely love you for it. You&#039;re going to absolutely crush it. That&#039;s what the smart consultants do. They forget about everything else that everyone else obsesses over, because that&#039;s what everyone else is doing. Most successful people are just like, &quot;Screw that. I&#039;m not doing any of it.&quot; Then they just focus on the two little things or the one to two to three things, and they just get those right. Then when they get those right, everything else looks after itself and no one even cares that they didn&#039;t have all of this other stuff in there.


That is why we reason with first principles instead of analogy. This is probably one of the most powerful things that you will learn in business and in your life, being able to assist different arguments and decisions with one type of logic compared to the other. First principles method, once you learn how to use it, you become pretty dangerous.


Now, I&#039;ve also included a pin-up of this page right here, available in the resources for download beneath this video. I recommend downloading this and printing it out, putting it on your wall, and always remind yourself of how we do this. Remind yourself that we want to analyze all of your decisions with first principles, not analogy. I&#039;m pretty sure you&#039;ve got it by now. Like I said, we want to apply this thinking to our offer. We load up the offer analysis worksheet and we start really assessing each component of the offer to see whether it should be cut or left in based on first principles and also the results that those different scores provided us with.


You might be thinking why do we want to keep stripping back our offer? Why do we want to keep cutting away from it? Don&#039;t we want to add more stuff to it? Well, most people think that by doing more, they&#039;re achieving more, but they&#039;re wrong. Less is more. What I&#039;m going to show you in this next section is why less is more and why the power of focus is just really powerful. It&#039;s devastating. Here, there&#039;s an image of a magnifying glass burning some wood, and it can do that just with the sun. When the sun is just shining normally on the Earth, it&#039;s nice and warm, but when you focus it in with a magnifying glass, it causes fire. That&#039;s what focus is like.


Here&#039;s some different examples here. We&#039;ve got the magnifying glass setting something on fire. I&#039;m sure you tried that when you were a kid. It&#039;s pretty fascinating. All this is doing is taking energy. It&#039;s taking a wide amount of energy and it&#039;s channeling it in into something really small. Then, how does a screw or a nail go through a car tire and puncture it when the road doesn&#039;t puncture the tire? I mean, it&#039;s the same weight. Well, it&#039;s because it takes all of the pressure and it focuses it on a point just that small. When it takes all of that pressure and it focuses it on a small point, it&#039;s over. Then, you&#039;ve got Michael Jordan. He had just insane focus. He didn&#039;t want to go out and party. He didn&#039;t want to go out and do other things like everyone else was doing. All he wanted to do was just focus on the game. He just wanted to focus on being the best basketball player in the world. He didn&#039;t let anything else distract him.


We see it in nature with the sun. We see it with pressure on things. We see it mentally with mental focus. Then, another example is hedge funds. Most people think that hedge funds and investors, they have lots of different stocks, like hundreds of different stocks, and that is not true at all. Most serious hedge funds have no more than five. Sometimes they only have three. The reason why they do this is because they need to focus. They can&#039;t know everything about, really, any more than five things at one time. This is even when they&#039;ve got a huge team. They&#039;re still really only in five stocks, because they can&#039;t get anything done properly when they&#039;ve got lots of things. Investors that have more than, like, 20 stocks or, God forbid, more than 100 stocks, those people, most of the time, they have no idea what they&#039;re doing. You just can&#039;t be good at 100 things. The people who really concentrate their efforts, well, they&#039;re the best in the world.


We see this with Steve Jobs and Apple. When Steve Jobs left Apple, when he got fired, the company started adding all of these different products to their offerings, so they had tons of different things. They had a very wide variety of items. Then, when Steve Jobs came back to Apple, the company was almost bankrupt. The company had, like, 90 days&#039; worth of money left in its bank accounts, and if it couldn&#039;t figure something out within 90 days, it was over. Well, the first thing Steve Jobs did when he came back to Apple was he just got rid of everything. He looked at the whole product line, and I can&#039;t remember how many things there were, but let&#039;s say there&#039;s 20 things. He looked at the product line of 20, and he said, &quot;Only two of these are worth selling,&quot; so he cut 18 of them. Just said, &quot;We&#039;re not selling this anymore.&quot; They just focus on two. By doing that, they got themselves out of trouble, and they became the best computer company for a world and, for a while, the most valuable company in the world. It was above Exxon Mobile and everything, number one for a while.


This is a very good lesson for most business owners and consultants and everything. If you have multiple offers, chances are that only really one of them or two of them is really worth selling, and you&#039;re probably just clinging on to them because you made them and you may as well sell them because you&#039;ve got them. That&#039;s not the right way to think. Apply 80/20 analysis to it. Put it through the Offer Analysis Spreadsheet. Really dissect it, analyze it. If it&#039;s not worth selling, just cut it. Do less. You want to focus. The less you do, the more powerful you are. That is one of the key skills. I think a lot of people, they beat themselves up. They&#039;re like, &quot;Why can&#039;t I just do it? Why can&#039;t I do more stuff? Why can&#039;t I be more successful?&quot; Well, they&#039;re never going to be able to do more. They can only do what they&#039;re doing, so the only way to do more is get rid of stuff. That way, they&#039;ve still got the same amount of time and energy and effort, but it&#039;s just being channeled into lesser things. That&#039;s the real secret to it.


Another example, which fascinates a lot of people, is Infusionsoft and MailChimp. Infusionsoft is a big, complex software platform that has, like, a million features in it, and it&#039;s expensive to use. MailChimp&#039;s just a simple thing that sends emails and it&#039;s cheap. Well, MailChimp is worth way more money than Infusionsoft as a company. MailChimp has got a way higher valuation, and it&#039;s worth a lot more money, even though it does less. There&#039;s another example of focus. Often, the companies that do less are worth more. Often, the companies that do less make more. It&#039;s just how it works. By doing everything, Infusionsoft really isn&#039;t worth that much money.


Then we&#039;ve got McDonald&#039;s. When McDonald&#039;s first started, it had a really small menu. You could only really get one burger and fries, and they only really had one drink. That was it. That was their menu. When it was like that, it was a machine, and it became the most popular fast-food franchise in the world. It took over the world. Now, this is what a McDonald&#039;s menu looks like. It has all of this crap all over it, and it&#039;s so confusing. There&#039;s so much stuff on it, it&#039;s become bloated over time. McDonald&#039;s is failing right now. If you look at their financials and everything, they&#039;re in serious trouble. They&#039;re pretty much on their way out, and it&#039;s because they haven&#039;t gone and refined it. McDonald&#039;s CEOs should go and pull up the Offer Analysis Worksheet. Put all of their different menu items through there and see what happens. Cut everything out.


Then, you probably see this one all the time. People that say they&#039;re consultants or they own agencies or they can help you with all of these different things. They&#039;re like, &quot;yeah, we&#039;ll help you with SEO. We&#039;ll do your website. We&#039;ll do your design. We&#039;ll get your business cards. We&#039;ll do your sign writing. We&#039;ll do your Google display. We&#039;ll do your AdWords. We&#039;ll do your Facebook ads. What else you need? Your print letter heads, we&#039;ll do that. We can get you some banners. We can get you some flags. We can get you some mugs.&quot; These companies that do all of that, even if they just do these four things on here, well, you know they&#039;re lying so you just run. No one can do all four of these things at one time, let alone 100 things.


By offering more services, quite often, these companies are really offering nothing at all. When I see a menu that has lots of things in it, I know that, really, it&#039;s all going to be bad. When I see something that&#039;s really refined, I&#039;ve got a lot more trust that it&#039;s going to work. When I see someone that just offers one thing, I know that there&#039;s a high chance that they&#039;re going to know what they&#039;re doing. This is just why focus is so powerful.


You&#039;re probably thinking why does this happen? I get it, I understand, but why? Well, it&#039;s very simple. We pretty much all have equal amounts of energy. The sun has energy. Everything has energy. We ourselves have energy. Mental energy, physical energy. We all pretty much have the same amount of energy. There&#039;s no really getting any more energy than someone else. All we can really do to beat other people and to focus is to really just channel all of our energy into one thing. Here is an example of the same amount of energy, but here, it&#039;s split across eight things. You can see it only makes this little piece of progress out here in these eight different ways.


Now, over here, we&#039;ve got the same amount of energy, but this is just channeled into one thing. I just took all of these different arrows and I added up all of those different things. It&#039;s this much. This is the same amount of energy. This human being here could be doing the same amount of work in a day, the same hours, the same everything, but if you focus on one thing, you can go that far. If you focus on eight things, well, you only go that far. That&#039;s just how it works. That&#039;s how focus works.


Here&#039;s a printout available for download beneath this video, and it&#039;s called The Power of Focus. Everything in the universe has energy. The sun, objects, companies, and us as people. The sun is warm and doesn&#039;t cause fires, but when focused with a magnifying glass, the same energy can start a fire very quickly. The weight of a car doesn&#039;t pop the tires, but when focused on the point of a nail, that same weight punctures it with ease. The focus of a company, when applied to a range of products and services, doesn&#039;t achieve anything special, but when focused onto one thing, it becomes the best. The focus of a human, when applied to a range of tasks, doesn&#039;t achieve anything special, but when focused onto one thing, it becomes superhuman. It&#039;s really important to remember just how powerful this stuff is. So this is a printout, a pin-up, available for download beneath this video. I suggest printing it out and putting it up on your wall, too. You want to constantly remind yourself of this.


I need to remind myself of this all the time, as well. If I want to get something done, I&#039;ve got to just block everything out and focus on one thing, one thing only. As you&#039;ve observed, focus is devastatingly powerful. Let&#039;s apply it to your offer. This is your Offer Analysis Worksheet again. You want to pull this up, and you want to go to 80/20 offer refinement and your new offer, and you want to use these two lessons I&#039;ve just taught you, which one of them is first principles method. You want to start thinking using that. Don&#039;t just think ab that different pieces of your offer because other people are doing them or because your competitors are doing them. Wrong way to think. Think about the power of focus. Really, you should be focusing on one thing. What is that one thing? What&#039;s that one thing in your offer that you should be putting pretty much all of your effort and energy into? If it&#039;s not one thing, then what two or what three? You should really be able to identify three things that your focus should be on.


Whatever those three things are, you really just want to highlight them. You can go to your new offer. You could highlight those three things there. You just want to click on this and them, bam, like that. You want to remind yourself of what is most important. What things do you need to focus on to really move the needle in your business?


Less is more. What you want to do is just learn to starve your mind of distractions and feed the focus. You&#039;ve got to really learn to starve your mind of this. Your mind all the time wants to add things on. It can&#039;t stand doing the same thing over and over again. It wants to add things. With your offer, you&#039;re going to want to add these different things. With your services, you&#039;re going to want to offer these different services. Don&#039;t do it. Really learn to starve your mind of these distractions. It kind of hurts, at first, not doing it. You get these urges to add things, but when you don&#039;t, you develop a lot of self-control. Then, that&#039;s when you&#039;re really able to focus.


There&#039;s a reason why Steve Jobs didn&#039;t have any furniture in his house. You can Google it. He pretty much had no furniture. The reason why he did that is because it&#039;s really painful to look at walls in a house without having furniture and different things in different places. Immediately, your mind goes to work, and it wants to think what could I put there? What could I put there? What could I buy and put there? It takes a lot of discipline to just leave it empty and not put anything there and just learn to appreciate it with nothing there. That&#039;s why Steve Jobs did that. He was training himself to really think clearly. He had the discipline to just leave the house blank like that. By doing that, he was able to really build his discipline and really build his focus. That&#039;s one of the main reasons why Apple products are so good and why Apple as a company was so successful. Not because they did more. Not because Steve Jobs worked more hours or anything like that. It&#039;s because he really learned to focus, and he understood that less is more.


So you want to learn to starve your mind of distractions and feed that focus. It is the most powerful skill in the world.
