                        Hey, everyone. It&#039;s Sam Ovens here and welcome to this training module called Project Management and Workflows. So in this training module, I&#039;m going to show you how to manage all of the different projects that you&#039;re going to have within your consulting business, whether those are client projects or your own projects and how to work effectively with contractors or employees or teammates if you have them and how to really create workflows for the key processes in your business.

So this training module is going to be of a lot of value if you already have clients and you&#039;re already running your business. However, if you&#039;re just getting started and you&#039;re trying to get clients in the door and you don&#039;t have any just yet, then this probably isn&#039;t going to be as much help. So this is more of a managing what clients you&#039;ve got video. So with that being said, let&#039;s jump right into it.

So here&#039;s what we&#039;re going to cover on today&#039;s training. So we&#039;re going to start off by discussing how we create order from chaos. So when you get started with your consulting business and things are quite simple. You add a few more clients on and then before you know it, things become chaotic. There&#039;s things that are hitting you from every angle and it&#039;s like you can&#039;t really conquer it.

If this is happening to you, then it&#039;s totally normal. It happens to a business at all of these different stages. There&#039;s ways to calm it down and there&#039;s ways to really create order from the chaos. We&#039;re going to discuss that. We&#039;re going to show you how to do that. Then we&#039;re going to discuss switching to the decentralized consulting model. So there&#039;s really the classic type of consulting is really a centralized model, where the consultant is at the center of everything. We&#039;re going to discuss a new way of thinking and a new consulting model called the Decentralized Consulting Model and this is extremely powerful.

If you are able to switch to this decentralized model, then you&#039;re able to scale up a whole lot more with your business, take on a lot more work without really adding more people onto more seats and without working more hours and all of that stuff. It&#039;s a way to scale without putting in more work.

Then we&#039;re going to show you step-by-step how to create your own workflows and processes. So I&#039;m just going to show you exactly how to do it, why you need it, all of that. Then we&#039;re going to discuss the software stack, the tools that help. So when it comes to project management working with contractors and creating workflows and everything, there is some software programs that can really help you. I&#039;m going to share with you the stack which we use and which a lot of my clients use and you&#039;re welcome to use those platforms as well.

Then finally, we&#039;re going to discuss some 10x productivity hacks and the power of deep work. At the end, we&#039;re really just going to discuss some methods and some tactics to really getting into the zone and really getting into that cool, clear, focused mode. That&#039;s typically where your absolute best work happens. So you want to be there as much as possible. So that&#039;s what we&#039;re going to cover on today&#039;s training. Let&#039;s get right to it.

Once you get a handful of consulting clients, you&#039;ll notice that project management becomes an issue. In the beginning, it&#039;s all about getting that first client and then the second one and then the third. Very quickly, the work stacks up, things get messy and managing the clients you have becomes your main focus. This is why project management and workflows are important. This training module is going to show you how to manage your clients effectively and conquer the chaos, so that you can continue to scale. So let&#039;s get to work.

The first section is creating order from chaos. So here&#039;s why most consulting businesses turn chaotic as soon as they get a handful of clients. So why consulting businesses descend into chaos? Most consultants start out on their own and they&#039;re the ones who know how to do everything. That makes sense, right? Because they&#039;re the consultant, so that&#039;s how it starts. They have a process of working with clients delivering the work, et cetera, but it&#039;s all in their head. They never formalize it, they never put it into any workflows or anything. It&#039;s just all in their head. That&#039;s perfectly natural. That&#039;s how it happens.

Then the consultant structures the business with them at the center of everything. This works well in the beginning, but it breaks down as soon as they get a handful of clients. The consultant puts off working with an assistant, contractors or anybody other than themselves because they&#039;re the only ones who understand how everything works. There&#039;s no process or workflow documented anywhere. I see this happen all the time and I saw it happen with myself multiple times.

You start out, you get into something and you&#039;re by yourself. You master it and it&#039;s all in your head. So it&#039;s fast for your to do everything. Then as your business starts scaling up, there comes a time when you just can&#039;t do everything. It&#039;s impossible. So you put off hiring people because you got to show them what to do and you think they won&#039;t be able to do it because it&#039;s all in your head. This is a crucial time for every consulting business.

Consultants in this situation can&#039;t scale pass the point they&#039;re at and their growth freezes. They typically stay in this position for the rest of their consulting career or they burn out completely and their business shrinks or disintegrates all together. So I see this happen all the time. Most consultants, they get to this point and they either just stay where they&#039;re at because they can&#039;t scale because they can&#039;t possibly scale. I mean, they can&#039;t put in any more hours, so they just stay where they&#039;re at and they just hover.

Then the other type is the type that keeps adding on more scale and they keep trying to work harder and harder and harder, but then eventually, they either dislike their business so they quit and give up or they just burn out and their business collapses anyway. So this is what happens.

Here&#039;s the crux of the issue. Here&#039;s really where it all starts. It&#039;s these two models. The classical way of doing consulting and everything, consulting, coaching, services and all of that, is the centralized consulting model. Most consultants start out using a centralized control model with them at the center of everything. This includes clients, contractors, billing, support, et cetera. This is the best model to use when starting out because you can oversee everything yourself. It&#039;s fast, it&#039;s simple and you don&#039;t need to rely on anything else.

The problem arises when you start to add more clients, contractors and processes to the system with you still at the center. Eventually, with enough scale, this model will break and/or the consultant will burn out. So the way to understand this model is you&#039;re the red dot and all these other dots out here, they&#039;re all different clients or contractors or tasks or whatever.

For anything to happen, it has to come through you. So if a contractor needs some information from a client, well, that&#039;s got to relay through you. The contractor can&#039;t go to the client, client can&#039;t go to the contractor. I mean, it&#039;s just all you in the middle. Everything is coming through you. A support question, a billing question, just absolutely everything is coming through you. That&#039;s the centralized consulting model.

This is the decentralized consulting model. So this is what I have really been pushing with Consulting.com and my training programs. It&#039;s really decentralizing the consulting business model and making it like this. So for consulting business to scale successfully, it must switch from a centralized model to a decentralized model.

A decentralized model means that the consultant is no longer the only resource for information. There are multiple sources for information and both clients and contractors can go to these sources and get what they need without interrupting the consulting. Most people think that this means hiring people, but that&#039;s not the only way. You can use things like Facebook groups, FAQ documents, help centers, workflow documents, et cetera.

So you&#039;re still at the center here, but now, we have got these extra pieces out here, which are at the center of different things. So you could create a help center for your clients, which has an FAQ document and it answers the most common questions that you get. So when your clients need help, I mean, they could just go to this help center first. You&#039;ve got four different clients, for example, they could just go to the help center and get the information they need without having to come to you.

In that way, there&#039;s only one connection. You add the content to the help center and then the help center serves it to these other four. Another thing you could have is you could have a virtual assistant that could handle your email or whatever. So people that ask you all of these random things, instead of them all coming to you, now it comes to the virtual assistant and then you&#039;re here or you could have a Facebook group. Without our Facebook group, we&#039;d probably have to have about 10 times the customer support people, but because of the Facebook group, it really helps build the community and it helps everyone have that information source and support network that is decentralized. That&#039;s another thing our company has out here.

So this is really the model that I&#039;ve been pushing. It&#039;s basically to take the knowledge off the consultant at the center here and start relaying out to these different assets out here. Then now, all of these people can just feed off of these different assets and every now and then when you have to update these assets and if you look at the two models, you can see how many connections are made through the first one and how many connections are made through the second.

Now, there is the same number of dots in the first model and in the second model, the same number of dots. On this first one, there&#039;s, I don&#039;t know how many, probably 20 or 16 connections going straight into this, right? So we&#039;ve got the same number of dots, but there&#039;s 16 connections coming in. Here, we only have one, two, three, four, five, we&#039;ve got six, all right?

So we&#039;ve got the same number of clients and contractors and everything. With the centralized model, we&#039;ve got 16 things coming in. With the decentralized model, we&#039;ve only got six. So it&#039;s a way to actually still have the same amount of clients but have less work. These clients out here and everything, they&#039;re actually more satisfied when it&#039;s decentralized because they can get the information immediately because you think about what a client wants when they need something from you.

They don&#039;t want you. They don&#039;t care about you. All they want is the information. So what&#039;s really relaying through this network here is not you. You&#039;re not cutting off a piece of you and sending it through this network. You&#039;re relaying some information. One of these dots need something, it travels down here, it comes to you, you relay it back, boom.

Now, there&#039;s a lag here. Sometimes it&#039;s a day, two days, whatever, because you&#039;re busy and you&#039;ve got all this other stuff. If you have this out here, this asset which they can access at any time, well, this is instant. So now, these clients are happy and because all they wanted was the information, not you. This is a big thing that consultants have to get their heads around.

So this decentralized consulting model is really, this is really the way to go once you get up in size. Once you&#039;ve got five to 10 clients, you want to start switching towards this model because this model is the only way that you can really grow and keep your sanity and profit margins. So when you get to the five to 10 client range, switching to the decentralized consulting model is vital. So let&#039;s map yours out right now, so switching to the decentralized consulting model.

So when it comes to changing models, the first step is to map out your current model. This is step one. This is a little exercise, which you can do right now. You just want to grab a couple of sheets of paper or a pad or a notebook or whatever. We&#039;ll go through step one. Step one, mapping your current consulting model.

Take a sheet of paper and map out the current model that your consulting business uses. You want to start by plotting yourself in the center there like that red dot and then start plotting all the different people that are involved. Then you want to connect the plots to the source they need to feed on when it comes to information.

So just grab a piece of paper. This is just really easy to do. It doesn&#039;t have to look fancy or anything. Draw you, just the circle in the middle. Now, start drawing out your different clients and you can name them if you want, then your different contractors and the different people that are all involved. Then draw the connections like when they need information, where do they go. Draw all the connections.

What you&#039;ll be pretty surprised to do is ... What you&#039;ll be pretty surprised to see is that everything just comes straight through you. As you evolve quite a lot and you have really started to build into the decentralized model, then chances are your model looks like this.

Once you&#039;ve plotted everything, you can think of, start listing all the different things that each person needs when it comes to information. This should be easy for you to do because you&#039;re at the center of everything now most likely. This could be things like billing, invoices, support questions, information about particular processes, et cetera. So think about what everyone asks you. We have plotted all of this different people on this map. We&#039;ve got you at the center. Now, we know the communication lines, right? That&#039;s good. Now, what things are traveling through these lines? What questions?

If you don&#039;t know, check your email inbox. Think about the people that call you. Think about the people that message you on Skype or want to have meetings or whatever. I mean, this is easy to do. Just start making a list of all the different things that people need from you. You want to pause this video right now and do that. Once you&#039;re done with step one, then you can proceed to the next step.

So the second step is to think of some new sources of information. This is step two, thinking of new information sources. You want to look at your current consulting model, the people involved and the types of information they need, which you have from step one. Then you want to think what resources could you create so that people don&#039;t need to come to you, but they can use their resource instead. You&#039;re just brainstorming some ideas here.

So you could come up with an idea like a Facebook group or a help center or an FAQ document or workflow documents or whatever. So look at all the different pieces of information people need from you and start brainstorming some different ideas.

Out of all the ideas that you came up with for new information sources, what one would have the most impact right away? Which one would change your life the most? Which one would change your business the most? Well, circle it. This will be the first resource we create, so that we can decentralize your consulting model. So pause this video now, complete this exercise. Once you&#039;ve done that, you can continue.

So the third step is to map out your new consulting model. Step three, mapping your new consulting model. Now that you know what resources you can create, plot the new consulting model on paper and connect all the dots so you can see what it would look like.

Now that you&#039;ve come up with this idea for this new information source, we want to see a before and after. We&#039;ve got your before image of your model without the information source. Now, let&#039;s get an after image if we were to implement this information source. Let&#039;s say it was a Facebook group or a workflow document, whatever.

You want to name each resource so that you know what it is. If you&#039;re just going to roll out one resource, label it &quot;Facebook group&quot;. If you&#039;re going to roll out multiple, say &quot;Facebook group&quot;, &quot;Workflow document&quot;, whatever. Then the final step is to circle the highest impact resource that you selected from the previous step. This is the first resource your going to implement and the rest can follow. You always want to work on one thing at a time.

So you might brainstorm out here a bunch of different resource. It&#039;s fun to think out into the future and think, &quot;Okay. How well could we really decentralize this model? Probably pretty well.&quot; Now, what you have to do is you have to prioritize. Which thing is going to come first? Which thing is priority number one? You want to circle that. That&#039;s what we&#039;re going to work on one at a time. We&#039;re not going to touch anything else until this one&#039;s built.

Now, the next step is creating your workflows and processes. Now that you have mapped out your new consulting model, it&#039;s time to map out some key process workflows so that people can follow them. You&#039;re probably thinking, &quot;What&#039;s a workflow?&quot; Well, this is the definition of a business workflow. A workflow is a progression of steps that could be tasks, events, interactions, anything, that make up a work process and create or adds value to the business.

In a sequential workflow, each step is dependent on the occurrence of the previous step and in a parallel workflow, two or more steps can occur at the same time. So when you&#039;re creating a workflow for your business, you want to think about things like onboarding clients. If you&#039;re in the done-for-you business, then onboarding clients is a bit of a process. You need to get information from them. You need to talk to them. You need to get all of the stuff together. Then when they&#039;re onboard, you need to set them all up, deliver the work. I mean, there&#039;s a lot of processes involved.

The worst thing to do is to just wing it every time because if you just wing it every time, something is bound to break and the results you get from it are bound to be unpredictable because every time it&#039;s different. So once you&#039;ve really figured out what works for you, you want to map out your workflow and this is how you do it.

The difference between a sequential one and a parallel, well, a sequential one means that each step has to come after the other step. So for example, if someone needed to start a business and they would probably need something to sell before they started selling it. That&#039;s just very basic. One thing has to come before the other. However, if it was redesigning the website and redoing the offers, I mean, those things can happen at the same time, so that you could have two flows happening. That&#039;s the difference between sequential and parallel.

You&#039;re probably thinking, &quot;Why do we need workflows? Doesn&#039;t this sound a bit too formal or a bit too corporatey for us running out little businesses?&quot; Here&#039;s why you need them. So when you&#039;re a consultant providing done-for-you services or advice, it&#039;s a good idea to map out your key processes and workflows so that you can remember what to do every time and keep the results consistent.

Even though some pilots have flown over 10,000 hours and know everything about flying and the aircraft like the back of their hand, they still follow simple checklists and workflows every time they takeoff, fly and land. Every single time, good pilots will follow these all the time because they just don&#039;t want to mess anything up and they know that human error is a huge thing.

By creating workflows, we remove the human error from the process and we help eliminate errors and we improve the speed and make the outcome and result more predictable. These are all things that we want in our consulting business. So if we&#039;ve got a process that works, we want to stick to it, right? Now, if we&#039;re trying to improve the process, sure, we want to try and iterate a few things, but when we work and we just want to stick to it and just keep rolling it out, I mean, we just want to leave it the same.

Now, when you&#039;re just getting started, there&#039;s not much point creating workflows because you don&#039;t know what they look like and you will have to work through a lot of trial and error to find the best path. So if you&#039;re just getting started and you haven&#039;t really gotten into the groove of things and you haven&#039;t got a refined process that you&#039;re implementing for people and getting them results with, then don&#039;t worry about mapping out a workflow. It&#039;s not going to help you at all.

In the beginning stages, things are messy and things are chaotic. That&#039;s how things have to start. Nothing can be orderly in the beginning. Everything has to be chaotic in the beginning because that&#039;s how we learn. That&#039;s how we learn what works and what doesn&#039;t and it&#039;s how we get a grasp on all of the different variables and how they all come together to produce a result.

So if you&#039;re just getting started, do not think that you have to create workflows. Please do not create workflows. In the early stages, workflows are more likely to harm than they are to help because you&#039;ll be trying to be strict and sticking to a process that probably doesn&#039;t work, which is pointless. You&#039;re better off to be scrappy and iterate all the time and work through all the different variables until you found it.

Once you found it at that moment, that is when you put it into a workflow. Then every now and then, you&#039;re welcome to update your workflow, but you want to try and stick to it as much as possible because once you&#039;ve got something that works, you just want to keep repeating it again and again and again. That&#039;s how you get good results as a consultant.

So you want to create workflows when you have a proven process in place, so that you can remember the ingredients and the recipe and the order in which they go together to produce the end result. A perfect example of this is imagine a chef just cooking in the kitchen trying different stuff. At the time that they&#039;re trying different stuff, they&#039;re not worried about creating recipes. They&#039;re throwing together random ingredients. They&#039;re throwing in some of those, some of that, &quot;Oh, I wonder what this will go like. I have no idea. Let&#039;s just throw it in and see.&quot;

They&#039;re just throwing in all of these different things and sometimes it doesn&#039;t work. Most of the time it doesn&#039;t work, but every now and then they&#039;re like, &quot;Whoa! This thing is good.&quot; Then at that moment when they&#039;re like, &quot;Whoa! This thing is good,&quot; they&#039;re like, &quot;Okay. What went into this?&quot; That&#039;s when they start creating their recipe. Then they try and repeat that recipe again and they&#039;re like, &quot;Yeah, this is good.&quot; Then they repeat it again and they&#039;re like, &quot;Yeah, this is good. All right. This is now a recipe. Now we can publish this.&quot;

That&#039;s how it happens for consultants too. We&#039;re in the kitchen. It metaphorically for us is just working with different clients, trying different things, trying to figure out what works and what doesn&#039;t. A lot of things aren&#039;t going to work, but we&#039;re going to strike on something that does. When we do find something that does work, we need to create the recipe. We need to create the workflow so that we can repeat the result. So I hope that makes sense for everyone.

Now, you&#039;re probably thinking, &quot;Well, how do we create workflows? I know why they&#039;re important. I know why we need them to scale and everything, but how do we actually create them?&quot; Well, here&#039;s a process to create workflows. I&#039;m going to walk you through this on my screen step-by-step right now. The first step is to list the different processes within your business. You should have a list of all of the different processes you&#039;ve got.

This should have come back from when you are looking at module one in week six, which is called Minimum Viable Service Delivery and we really dissected your offer and your service delivery into its separate components, right? That was the worksheet called Offer Analysis Worksheet. In there, you should have really cut it down and dissected it and looked at all the different processes or you want to start step one in this process. Start by just listing those out. List them on a piece of paper or in a Google Doc or whatever.

Now, you want to rank them in order of importance from one being most important to 10 being least important. We rank importance based on how important these processes are to add value. So if it&#039;s a process like how to open email, okay, it&#039;s not very valuable, but if it&#039;s a process like how to set up a Facebook ads campaign for our clients when that&#039;s what we&#039;re supposed to be doing, I&#039;d say that&#039;s pretty important. So you want to map that process out. I mean, you want to select your most important process in that list of processes.

Now, step three, take the most important process on your list and commit to creating a workflow for this one first. So forget about the other ones. We focus on one thing at a time. So once you&#039;ve got that one there, circle it. That&#039;s what we&#039;re going to be creating. Now, what you want to do is open up a new Google Doc and create a numbered list and start typing the process steps. Sometimes the best way to do this is to wait until you have to do this process again and then create the steps as you work.

So what I mean by this is sometimes it&#039;s hard to think about the actual process if we&#039;re not doing the process. So if I&#039;m thinking instructions on how to create a good Facebook ads account, I can&#039;t create those instructions properly unless I go in and actually create a Facebook ads account. So the best way sometimes is to add it to your to-do list and then the next time you go and create a new campaign, create the campaign but each step of the way, document how you&#039;re doing it. Start documenting the workflow. Honestly, the best time to create workflows is when you&#039;re actually doing the job itself. Don&#039;t create instructions that aren&#039;t to do with actually executing the job. They&#039;ll be horrible instructions and it will be a horrible workflow.

So what I&#039;m going to show you right now is some example from our company, Consulting.com, some documented workflows. So step four is to open up a new Google Doc and create a numbered list and create the steps. I&#039;ve loaded up two on my computer here. The first one is a process for scheduling group Q&amp;A calls. So I used to have to do this myself. I used to have to go into GoToWebinar every week and I&#039;d have to schedule all of these calls for our different programs, Accelerator, Uplevel and Quantum Mastermind. There&#039;s a lot of calls. We have to make sure they&#039;re all scheduled at the right times and everything.

To do that, there was a process. So what I decided to do is map out this process and create a workflow. I created the instructions. I&#039;ve put the weekly schedule in here. Then I put in the logins and everything to GoToWebinar and I included the link to it. Then I also created a video explaining how to actually schedule the calls as well. So I really created a whole workflow.

Then after that was done, I created a workflow for a process for posting the Q&amp;A call times. So after we schedule the calls in GoToWebinar, we then have to post them in the Facebook group. So you would have seen this happened multiple times. You&#039;re in the Facebook group. You&#039;ve seen different calls get posted. Well, there&#039;s a whole workflow and process behind that to make sure that no one makes any mistakes because if someone scheduled one of the calls at the wrong time, that&#039;s going to be a problem or if someone forgets to schedule them at all, that&#039;s going to be a problem.

That&#039;s why we don&#039;t rely on just memory and human error. We document the process and we have it like this. So I created the whole workflow and this workflow is being adjusted a couple of times since I created it because Nick Hauser is in-charge of this now. Originally, I created something like this and Nick&#039;s obviously iterated and improved upon it from here.

You can see it says exactly what to do. We&#039;ve got to create two events in the Facebook group. Then we have to ... Here&#039;s the link to the Facebook group. Then we have to put this photo in, event name and then the times and everything. Then here&#039;s the description to copy/paste. Then we put the link from GoToWebinar in here, the settings to select when doing it, then the description text for posting on the main wall. So all he has to do is copy/paste this and follow the instructions. It means it&#039;s easy.

It&#039;s for Accelerator and for Uplevel Consulting, which is our mid-level program. There&#039;s the details on that and then for Quantum, which is our highest level program. Well, there&#039;s the details on that. There&#039;s also a video here explaining how to do it as well. So you can see full documented process.

So I was doing this myself and then I turned it into a workflow and then got Nick to start doing it. Nick was easily able to do it as soon as he had a workflow. Now, if Nick is sick or anything or if anything ever happens and someone else needs to do it, well, they would just load up this workflow and follow the instructions. So this is why we create one of these.

Now, back to my previous point, you don&#039;t want to create workflow documents in the beginning because your process is going to change so many times. So if you&#039;re just getting started, don&#039;t stress about workflows. This is only once you&#039;ve got a dialed in rinse and repeat process that&#039;s going to be repeated again and again and again like these Q&amp;A calls. I mean, we&#039;ve been scheduling four Q&amp;A calls a week between our different programs for two years. Now, that&#039;s a lot. That&#039;s more than 400 calls, right? So this process is being done 400 times. So obviously, it&#039;s worth creating a workflow document for.

So that is the step in the process. We open up a Google Docs and we type it out like that. Then what we do is step five is we create a Help Scout account. So you can go to Consulting.com/HelpScout and set up your support email address. So this is an awesome thing to do. I&#039;ll show you it right now. So Help Scout, if you go to Consulting.com/HelpScout, this tool is really, really powerful to use for your consulting business. I highly recommend it even when you&#039;re just getting started and only have one or two clients just because it&#039;s so powerful, it&#039;s such an awesome piece of software and it&#039;s very cheap.

So I&#039;m going to sign up. They give you a free trial. Then I&#039;m going to put in my company name and my name, my password, how many people, one to five, phone number optional, create my account. So you can sign up for a free trial there. Then I think it&#039;s only $12 a month or something to use Help Scout. It&#039;s worth the 12 bucks, seriously. It is going to really help you save a lot of time.

So you want to leave on the help desk function and the docs function and go next. Then we want to go create new mailbox. Then we want to just call this one, we would just call this mailbox demo. Well, let&#039;s say that I&#039;m just going to call it Sam Ovens Support, all right? Now, you would call yours your company name support. So if your company was called XYZ, then you would say, &quot;XYZ Support&quot; or if your name is Joe Bloggs, you&#039;d say, &quot;Joe Bloggs Support&quot;, all right?

Satisfaction ratings, you can leave this on or off. It doesn&#039;t really matter. Next step. Oh, sorry. You&#039;re supposed to put an email address in here. So what you want to do here is you want to put in <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="d98aaca9a9b6abad9980b6acab9db6b4b8b0b797b8b4bcf7bab6b4f7">[email&#160;protected]</a> So <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="ce9dbbbebea1bcba8e9dafa381b8aba0bd8aaba3a1e0ada1a3e0">[email&#160;protected]</a> Yours would be different, <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="f1a28481819e8385b1bb9e94b39d9e969682df929e9cdf">[email&#160;protected]</a>

Now, what were doing here is we&#039;re creating a support mailbox that isn&#039;t our email. Now, one of the best things to do in your consulting business is don&#039;t have support emails from your clients come to your inbox. They should be going into a general support inbox. I&#039;ll show you why in just a second. This is going to completely change everyone&#039;s life. Even if you&#039;ve only got one or two clients, you really want to do this. It&#039;s well worth it.

So <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="96c5e3e6e6f9e4e2d6cff9e3e4d2f9fbf7fff8d8f7fbf3b8f5f9fbb8">[email&#160;protected]</a> I&#039;m going to call this one Sam Ovens Support. Next step. Who else would use this mailbox? I mean, if you&#039;ve got a team, you can add this in, but I don&#039;t. I&#039;m just getting started here. Now, you have to set this up. I&#039;m going to show you how to set this up right now.

So what you want to do is you want to open up a new tab and go to Apps.Google.com, which is Google Suite and you should have a Google Suite account. You should have created one of these back in the assembling the war machine training back in week four. If you don&#039;t, go back to that now and you&#039;ll see instructions on how to set up G Suite.

Now, we go sign in and we put in our domain. So SamOvensDemo.com. Now, once you&#039;re logged in here into your Google Suite admin account, you want to select Users. Then what we want to do is we want to create a new user. So you&#039;re down here, you can go Add User. This one, you want to set up as your main support inbox. So I&#039;m going to call this one Sam Ovens Demo Support. So if your company is called XYZ, you&#039;d call it XYZ Support or if your name is Joe Bloggs, Joe Bloggs Support. The primary email address you want to use will be <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="c497b1b4b4abb6b0849dabb1b680aba9a5adaa8aa5a9a1eaa7aba9ea">[email&#160;protected]</a>

Now, I&#039;ve already got this one used, so I&#039;m going to have to just call this one <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="c093b5b0b0afb2b4f28084afada1a9ae8ea1ada5eea3afad">[email&#160;protected]</a>, all right? Then what we do is we click on Create. It will create us a new email account. Then what we want to do is we want to go show password here and we want to copy this password to our clipboard. Then we want to go ahead and log in on Gmail.com. We want to log in to that brand new account, which was <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="65361015150a1711253c0a1017210a08040c0b2b0408004b060a084b">[email&#160;protected]</a> So I&#039;m going to go ahead and do that right now.

So I&#039;m logged in it, my one. So what I want to do is I want to click up here and then select a different account. So I&#039;m going to add an account and I&#039;m going to type in here <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="92c1e7e2e2fde0e6a0d2d1fdfce1e7fee6fbfcf5bcf1fdffbc">[email&#160;protected]</a> Next, enter in that password, that temporary one that you would have copy/pasted, bam. Now, this is a new email account. You can see it&#039;s a separate Gmail account here. We&#039;re going to set up a new password for it and bam. Now, we&#039;re set up with this. So we just want to clean these things out in here.

Now, what you want to do is you want to come back to your Help Scout here. We want to forward emails to this address. So I&#039;m going to come in here. Actually, what I have to do is I have to just change something because it&#039;s actually <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="9ac9efeaeaf5e8eea8dad9f5f4e9eff6eef3f4fdb4f9f5f7">[email&#160;protected]</a> in this example. Next step. Next step. Now, what I&#039;m going to do is I&#039;m going to forward email to this. So we copy this to our clipboard. Now, we come in here to our support email. You want to click on the settings cog, settings. Now, you want to click on Forwarding. Add a forwarding address. You want to forward it to this crazy address, which Help Scout will give you. Then you want to go next.

Proceed, then okay. Now, what it&#039;s done is it&#039;s sent an email through to us with Help Scout. So I&#039;m going to all finished in here. Now, it says, &quot;A six-digit code has been emailed to this support email.&quot; So I&#039;m going to go here. I&#039;m going to check my email. Here&#039;s my six-digit code. I&#039;ll go ahead and drop that in here. Now, I&#039;m just going to come back into my inbox here. I&#039;m going to remove this demo box.

So if you&#039;ve got a demo mailbox, you want to go edit mailbox and you want to delete mailbox, delete. Oh, it&#039;s asking me for my password. All right. You should only have that one mailbox set up there. So I&#039;m going to jump into this one. You want to name it, your name support, <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="7b280e0b0b14090f3b22140e093f14161a1215351a161e5518141655">[email&#160;protected]</a> Then you can have an email signature. I think this one will be fine. From this, default, save. It&#039;s all done.

Now, I&#039;m going to click on Mailbox and I want to delete this one from Help Scout here. Then here, this one is to help us link up our Gmail. So we want to copy/paste this code and this email that&#039;s in our inbox. Then we want to go back here and we want to click on the settings cog. Then we want to click on Configure Inbox. Oops! We want to click on settings cog, then settings. Then we want to click on Forwarding and POP/IMAP. Then we want to put this confirmation code in here. Just copy it, click Verify. Now, it&#039;s verified.

Now, we want to make sure that we&#039;ve selected this forward a copy. We want to forward it to this and we want to, you want over here to just click Archive. Then once that&#039;s done, you want to click Save, bam. Now, what&#039;s going to happen is we just set up an email address at our DomainName.com, so <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="bae9cfcacad5c8cefaf0d5dff8d6d5ddddc994d9d5d794">[email&#160;protected]</a> In this case, I created <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="085b7d7878677a7c3a484b67667b7d647c61666f266b6765">[email&#160;protected]</a>, all right?

Now, whenever someone emails that email address, it&#039;s going to not come into my Gmail account. It&#039;s going to come into my Help Scout account. So I&#039;ll give you a demonstration so you can understand. Let&#039;s see. I&#039;m just going to go to this mailbox here. I&#039;m going to delete this. Let&#039;s make sure it&#039;s nice and clean. Delete everything out. Now, I can show you what it will look like.

So I will use my <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="93d7f6fefcd3d0fcfde0e6ffe7fafdf4bdf0fcfe">[email&#160;protected]</a> email. What I&#039;m going to do is I&#039;m going to send an email to <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="32614742425d40460072715d5c41475e465b5c551c515d5f1c">[email&#160;protected]</a> I want to call this Testing. Subject line, Testing Email Body. Let&#039;s say a client wants to contact you and they&#039;ve got a support question. So if a client wants to contact you directly, they&#039;d contact you on your direct email. However, if a client has a support question, you want to get into the habit of sending them to <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="7b280e0b0b14090f3b22140e093f14161a1215351a161e5518141655">[email&#160;protected]</a> You don&#039;t want to get support emails mixed up in your own email account even if you&#039;re doing the support yourself. So even if you&#039;re doing all the support, don&#039;t do it in your inbox. Separate it from your inbox, put it in this thing. It will honestly change everything for you. So I&#039;m going to send this.

Now, here&#039;s the Support2 email and as you can see, it&#039;s not getting any email here. Nothing came into its inbox, but what did happen is it came into Help Scout instead. So this is like our new place to go to handle support. So what happens is we go and set up inside of Google Apps or G Suite. We set up an additional user called Sam Ovens Support or Joe Bloggs Support. That sets on Gmail account, but we never log in to that account again once we&#039;ve set all of this up. All we ever log in to for our own email is our email account, but then for customer support, we go to Help Scout and then inside of Help Scout, we can see all of our customer support emails.

Now, you&#039;re probably thinking, &quot;Well, why have two things? Why not just use Gmail instead of this as well?&quot; Well, here&#039;s why. It will make it so much easier because in here, if I click on this, it pulls up the whole history of this chain of events. So if I click right now Reply, I can type something in and I can go, &quot;Message 2 back and forward.&quot; I&#039;m just writing some random stuff. Then I just hit send reply, bam. So now that&#039;s handled. Now, if I come back here and I get this email, here it is. So here&#039;s the reply back.

So you can see now when I replied from this, from within Help Scout, it replied back here and it said, &quot;Message 2 back and forward.&quot; Now, your client can just go in here and be like, &quot;Message 3 back and forward.&quot; Then hit send. So the client just feels like he or she is emailing you personally on email, right? It doesn&#039;t change the feel or anything, but for your sake, it makes it a lot more organized because when you&#039;re in your email address, you should be looking at things which has to do with sales and things like that.

You need to be in two different minds. You don&#039;t want to be doing sales stuff and then have to deal with customer support. You only want to deal with support when you&#039;re dealing with support. So once every two days or something, you should come in and check the support inbox in here. Then when we open up these conversations, you can see how it has the full history here and it makes it a lot easier to handle.

Then later on when you need to go back and check client communications and everything, you&#039;re going to have them all saved in this place within Help Scout. Then what happens is your life&#039;s going to be totally organized because anything that your client is sending you to do with support, it&#039;s going to be in Help Scout. Then anything that your client is sending you about sales and signing up and whatever, well, that&#039;s going to be in your own email account. You want to separate these two things.

Then what really changes the game for you is when you get enough clients and things have really started to pile up or you want to hand this over to someone to do your customer support. When you hire someone, you&#039;re not going to have to train them as much. You&#039;re not going to have to teach them how to do all the weird things you&#039;re doing in Gmail. They will just everything in Help Scout. They can look at closed tickets in here and they can see how you handled everything and they can learn from those.

So I can&#039;t recommend this thing enough. It&#039;s 12 bucks a month and it will give you your own support email address, which makes you look a lot more professional and it will also improve your productivity and everything like that. So you definitely want to set that one up.

Now, the next step is to create a Docs Help Center within Help Scout and set it up on your own domain. So how we do this is we click on Docs up the top. You want to call this one just, let&#039;s just call it Docs. We can have it public. Now, we want to go and open Docs. Why we use Help Scout is these two reasons. Number one is it gives us an awesome support inbox that we can handle all of our customer support. Number two, it provides us with an awesome knowledge base to store all of our workflows.

So this is what Help Scout calls a Docs website. So we go and create one. Then what we do is we want to add a category. This one category I might call it Facebook Ads Processes or let&#039;s just call it Facebook Ads. Create category. Then I might have another category and this one&#039;s called Community Management. Create category.

So now, you can see over here I&#039;ve got the different categories within my business, community management, Facebook ads, billing, whatever. Now, because these two workflows here that I showed you in Google Docs are to do with community management, what I&#039;m going to do is click on Community Management and then click Add A New Article. I&#039;m going to add this one in first.

We typed in Google Docs first to make it simple and then we just copy it over into Help Scout and then we click Create Article. Then we grab the text and we paste it in here just like that. Then I&#039;m just going to paste in this ... I&#039;m just going to clean this formatting up a little bit. Then we&#039;ve got Uplevel and then we&#039;ve got the Quantum. So you can just clean up the formatting of it like that. Then what I want to do is click Publish. Then what I want to do is go down here and just put an S here. Then I want to click on HTML.

What I want to do is I want to insert the video too because if you look here, if I go to this link, I had created a help video as well showing ... So we not only had the text instructions, we had video instructions. So what you want to do is hover over this video actions, then you want to go Embed and Share. Then you want to click on Popover Embed and then you just want to go copy/paste this and drop this code in here pretty much where I just put that S. Publish.

Now if I just click this little eye over here, I can view this article. I&#039;m just going to make this thing a bit bigger in Wistia. Where was it? Probably going to go 300. Now, I&#039;m going to copy this again. I&#039;m going to edit this and I&#039;m just going to remove this here, paste that back. Now if I look at it, oops, I&#039;ve still got the old one there as well. I&#039;ll just fix that up real quick. I&#039;m just going to get rid of all of that.

I just want to paste my Wistia code in here. Publish. Now, let&#039;s have a look. There we go. You can see that I&#039;ve got a knowledge base here now. See, it&#039;s demo company LLC knowledge base. This is a really cool place to store all of your workflows so that you can share it with other team members as you hire them or you can share it with your contractors. You can share it with everyone inside your company. You can even share it with yourself because you want to create these workflows even just for yourself because it makes it a lot easier to do each time.

A pilot, even if he&#039;s flying his own airplane in his own time and he&#039;s by himself, he&#039;s still going to follow the checklist because he doesn&#039;t want to make a mistake because he doesn&#039;t want to crash. When you&#039;re running your consulting business, if you&#039;ve got to run processes again and again, you want to follow instructions too just so that it&#039;s a lot easier, you&#039;ll be a lot more efficient and you have less chance of making errors.

So that was the first one we set up. Now, I&#039;m going to click back on Community Management and click New Article. This second one I&#039;m going to create, I&#039;ve done the workflow process for scheduling the group calls. So now I&#039;m going to do the workflow process for posting Q&amp;A call times. Post that in, create article. Then I&#039;m going to grab this text. I&#039;m not going to bother about formatting this one because I don&#039;t want to make this video too long so I&#039;m just going to go and paste that in. I&#039;m just going to leave it rough like that, but you would go in and you&#039;d properly format this stuff.

Then you would go Publish. Then I&#039;m going to add in the video too, where they use SSR. To do that, I go to this URL. It&#039;s a good idea to create explain the videos too for yourself and for your own company. In our company, we create a text instruction set and also a video instruction set so that that way no one can possibly not understand what it is. We have two things available. So if someone prefers to read, they can read it. If someone prefers to watch video, they can watch a video.

So I&#039;m going to go Embed and then I&#039;m going to go Popover, 300 width, copy this. Then I&#039;m going to go ahead and drop this in here. Publish. Now, I can preview this and voila! Now, we&#039;ve got this knowledge base set up. If I click here, we can see that there&#039;s not only a search box that we can use ourselves or our team members can use, but there&#039;s also different categories. It might be community management, Facebook ads, new AdWords account, new SEO account or whatever things you&#039;ve got inside your company. You&#039;ve also got all of the different information that you need.

So I&#039;m going to go and quit out of this now. We&#039;ve created our knowledge base. I&#039;ve demonstrated how the support email address works. That&#039;s how we create Docs things in our ... I&#039;ll put in this category too in our knowledge base.

Now, I&#039;ll show you how to do one more thing, which you will want to do. That&#039;s set up your Docs website on your own domain name. So if I click on View Article, you can see here that it&#039;s some strange URL like DemoCompanyLLC.HelpScoutDocs.com. It&#039;s strange, right? So what I want to do is you want to click the settings cog and then you want to click Site Settings. I&#039;m going to get this first. I&#039;m going to call this one Sam Ovens Support. Then you could make it simple here if you wanted to. You could just call it SamOvensSupport.HelpScoutDocs.com and you could go save. That&#039;s going to make it a lot more simple. Now, it&#039;s just SamOvensSupport.HelpScoutDocs.com.

It&#039;s a lot easier for you to remember and your team and you can see it has your company name up here. You can use the search feature or we could go into either any category and then we could find our workflow document and then we could follow the instructions to implement the process, all right? It really is just that simple. You can do all of this with Help Scout for 12 bucks a month. So not only do we get the Docs website, we get the support email address too. So for 12 bucks, I mean, that&#039;s really good.

If you want to set up your own custom domain thing, you can do that here. I&#039;m not going to show you in this video because it&#039;s not necessary. I mean, it&#039;s not 100% essential. It&#039;s just a nice thing to do if you want to or if you&#039;ve got the time. If you follow these instructions here, it will show you how to do that.

So what I basically did is just created a knowledge base for our team or myself or our company. Now, what Help Scout allows you to do is you can create multiple knowledge bases. So you might create one for your team and then you might create one for your clients. So at our company, Consulting.com, we have Support.Consulting.com, all right? This is our knowledge base for our clients. So if you&#039;re a customer of Consulting.com and any of our programs, well, you can use our knowledge base here. There&#039;s a whole bunch of different things that relate to different questions. So if someone has questions about sales, they can see all of these different things like mastering your message and here&#039;s full-on instructions.

So why this is good for us is this stops a whole bunch of people writing to our support team and it stops a whole bunch of people having to go to the Facebook group. This is one thing we have in our business to really decentralize the whole model. So we&#039;ve got our Support.Consulting.com knowledge base. We&#039;ve also got our Facebook groups and then we&#039;ve got our content portal as well. All three of those things really decentralize it and takes a lot of strain off of the consultant.

Then we also have ones for our internal team and we have ones for all sorts of things. We&#039;ve got multiple knowledge bases. The ones I just showed you here like these processes for us ourselves like our team members, these aren&#039;t available on the one that&#039;s facing our customers because our customers don&#039;t need to know how to schedule the calls. The customers just need to know information about their problems.

So this is how you can create multiple knowledge bases. Eventually, you&#039;re going to end up with a few different knowledge bases for different people. You might have one for contractors. You might have one for yourself and then you might have one for your clients, right? By doing that, we really decentralize the model of our consulting business. Like I said, Help Scout for 12 bucks a month is it&#039;s amazing value and it will completely change everything for your business because you&#039;re able to organize everything so well.

That is our process. Let&#039;s get back to our instructions. Now, I&#039;ve shown you how to come up with a list of processes, find the most important process, type it up in Google Docs, then create a Help Scout account and set up your support email and then create a Docs Help Center within Help Scout and then copy/paste your workflow process from Google Docs into Help Scout.

Now from now on, whenever you have a process in your business that is done repeatedly, you want to create a workflow and then add it to Help Scout. When a process or workflow changes, adjust it in Help Scout. You want to keep this updated. If you keep your knowledge bases updated and your help center is updated for your team, for your contractors and for your staff, it will make a world of difference. It takes so much strain off of the consultant.

I see most consultants, all their contractors are still coming to them. All of their clients are still coming to them. Everyone is still coming to them and they have no time to think. They have no time to improve and no time to grow. If you want to start freeing up time in your consulting business, you need to switch to the decentralized consulting model and start building out assets like this. It will change the game for you.

Now, let&#039;s talk about the software stack. This is the stack of software that we use to really handle workflows, customer support and client management and things like that. Software Stack: The Tools That Help. Now that you&#039;ve got your decentralized model and workflows going, it&#039;s time to see the software stack that we use to run our consulting businesses efficiently. So let&#039;s take a look.

This is the project management software stack. So when it comes to customer support, we use Help Scout. It is hands down the best. I&#039;ve tried tons of things and our company has done more than 60,000 support tickets these days. Help Scout is the best and at 12 bucks a month, you can&#039;t beat it, so Consulting.com/HelpScout. Then workflows and knowledge bases, well, we get to kill two birds with one stone. Help Scout does that as well, so Consulting.com/HelpScout.

Now, if you need to do any project management like if you need to manage things with your clients or contractors or whatever, Trello is the one to use. You can go to Consulting.com/Trello. I&#039;ll show you what it looks like right now. I&#039;ll just give you a quick demonstration.

So Consulting.com/Trello and that will take us here. Now, you&#039;ll have to create an account. You can create a free account. I&#039;m already logged in. You can see how many different boards I&#039;ve got. So I&#039;ve got different teams like marketing team, financial team, development team and different things. You can find the different boards you&#039;re looking for. I&#039;ve got one called Front End Development right here. You can see this workflow we create here.

When it comes to creating different things inside your business, Front End Development is one of the workflows we have in our business. First of all, it&#039;s Aslam&#039;s job. We&#039;ll create a task for him and we might add a card in here like build. We might call something build out new landing page, all right? Now, I might create this thing here, this card inside Trello for Aslam and I&#039;ll explain instructions to do this and I&#039;ll just list all the different instructions and go save.

Now, I can assign it to whoever I want to assign it to. So I could assign it to Aslam because it&#039;s who I want to assign it to. Now, what will happen is he will see that in his backlog. Then he will prioritize what he&#039;s going to work on so then he&#039;ll drag this into his thing up next and then when he&#039;s actually working on it, he&#039;ll drag it into here.

So if I come back and I check this, I can see what Aslam is working on right now because he will have dragged this card from his backlog into his in progress thing. Then I can see what&#039;s up next for him. So if something becomes a higher priority, I can shuffle it around like that and he knows always to pick this thing off the top of the list. Then when he&#039;s working on this and when he&#039;s done with it, he&#039;ll move it into Sam Review.

Now, when it comes into Sam Review, that&#039;s when I have to look at it. So now, I&#039;ll open this up and I&#039;ll see what work Aslam has done and I&#039;ll see whether it&#039;s approved or not or whether I want to request changes. If I want to request changes, I&#039;ll drag it back to his backlog here. Then he&#039;ll see it and then he&#039;ll drag it through into in progress. I know he&#039;s working on it. Then when he&#039;s done, he&#039;ll put it into review. I&#039;ll check it again. If it&#039;s still not good, I&#039;ll drag it back into his backlog.

So it&#039;s a way to just move things through a list like this and work with multiple people. Now, once I&#039;ve approved it, the next step is for it to go to someone else in our team called Ahmed. So I might drag it into here into his backlog. Then when he&#039;s done with it or when he starts working on it, he&#039;ll put it into in progress. Then when he&#039;s done with it again or when he&#039;s done with it, he&#039;ll put it into Sam Review. I&#039;ll check it. If I want changes, I&#039;ll move it back to his backlog. He&#039;ll do it again, then it will come back to me to review. Then if it looks good and I think it&#039;s done, then I&#039;ll move it into Shipped and it&#039;s done. Shipped means complete.

So this is how it works. It&#039;s very simple. You couldn&#039;t have a project management system any more simple than this. I mean, we create a task for someone. They move it through here and then it comes out the other end. It works with different people because this is our workflow. It has to got through all of these steps to come to the final process. I&#039;m just going to delete that.

Now, I&#039;ll show you how to create a new Trello board just real quick in case you need to know that. So we go to Create New Board and let&#039;s call this one Demo or Testing Board. You can change the background of your thing like that. Then you can see there&#039;s no list across the top here. So the first thing you have to do is add some lists. So I might call this one Complete or Onboard New Client. Then it will come through here.

The next step in the process might be to conduct market research. Then the next step might be implement Facebook campaign. Then the next step might be check over campaign with client. The next step might be launch campaign. Then it might be hand over to manager to manage monthly. Then the last stage might be, just call it Process Complete.

Now, I just made this up. This is not a workflow. I just made it up to give you guys an idea. Let&#039;s say I&#039;m a Facebook ads consultant. So I need to onboard a client, do the market research, implement their campaign, then check it over with the client to make sure they&#039;re happy, then I&#039;ll launch it once they&#039;re happy. Then once it&#039;s launched and working, then I hand it over to a contractor to manage it month-to-month. Once that&#039;s done, then that client&#039;s been successfully onboarded and everything&#039;s good.

So let&#039;s say I sign up a new client and he&#039;s called Bob Jones and let&#039;s call it Account Setup. I could come in here, type any notes I need to know. Then while I&#039;m onboarding him, he&#039;s going to be here. Now, once he&#039;s successfully onboarded, then I can move it into market research. So now I know that I need to complete the market research for Bob Jones. So I&#039;m going to start doing all of that.

Then when I&#039;m done with the market research, I move it into this next category, implement the Facebook campaign. So now I&#039;m building out his campaign. Then once that&#039;s built out, I&#039;m going to move it here and I&#039;m going to check it over with the client himself to make sure he&#039;s happy before we go live. If he&#039;s happy, I move it into here and I launch the campaign and go live. then I&#039;m going to be doing my testing and everything. Then I&#039;m going to move it into here and I&#039;m going to hand it over to someone. Once it&#039;s successfully handed over, then I can move into the process complete.

So it&#039;s so simple. This is why I like Trello because it is just as simple as things can get. You can add multiple people into this thing and it just works so easy. If you want to know what your contractors are working on, you can just come in here and just look. You can just look at your board and see which things are in different stages. It&#039;s a good bird&#039;s eye view of your entire company to see how many projects you&#039;ve got going on and where they all are sitting in the workflow process.

Now, if you want to learn more about how to use Trello, then you can go and just create an account and play around with it. Otherwise, there&#039;s plenty of videos and instructions and things on the Trello website. I&#039;m not going to go into huge depth when it comes to using this thing because really, it doesn&#039;t require much knowledge. I mean, it&#039;s pretty simple and self-explanatory. So that&#039;s how that works. So that is Consulting.com/Trello.

Now for team communications and calls, I highly recommend Slack. With our company, we don&#039;t send each other email. Email is a pain in the ass. So when it comes to customer support, it all goes to Help Scout, no email. Then when it comes to talking to each other, no email. We just use Slack. So if you Consulting.com/Slack and you can create an account here. I&#039;m pretty sure it&#039;s free. This is a great place to communicate with your contractors and everything. It is an awesome platform to use.

I&#039;ll load mine one up real quick and show you what it looks like. Here&#039;s my Slack. You can see in here that this is what it looks like. It&#039;s a messaging thing. It works like it&#039;s a messaging application. Instead of using email, we use Slack. We want to try and keep out of email as much as possible to stay productive.

What we have down here on the left-hand side is a whole bunch of different channels. So if anything has to do with HR, it goes in there. If it&#039;s to do with front end development or backend development, if it&#039;s to do with data science, if it&#039;s to do with content or community or coaching or anything to with our team in New York or anything to do with our team in Ireland or if it&#039;s just general or if it&#039;s to do with research and development, the policing of our community, support, everything, we&#039;ve got all of our different teams in here.

So if I wanted to message anyone on my teams, I&#039;ll just click on one of these things and message and it would just start messaging them all or if I wanted to direct message anyone on my team, I&#039;ll just click on direct message and I&#039;d type in the person like Nick Hauser, bam. Then I&#039;d go Go. It would launch and I would be able to chat directly with him.

Now, the cool thing about using Slack is that it keeps all of your communications in one place. I see so many consultants and they use, they&#039;ve got all of these different things. They&#039;re using Gmail, they&#039;re using Skype, they&#039;re using text messages, they&#039;re using calls, they&#039;re using Facebook chat. They&#039;ve got all of these things and they&#039;re all in different places. That is a nightmare. If you have that many things and that many different places, it&#039;s going to break. You want to use something like Slack and keep it all organized.

The other good thing about Slack is that it&#039;s got the best search function I&#039;ve ever seen. For all chats that you&#039;ve ever had with anyone ever, any file attachments, anything, it&#039;s all going to be searchable and it&#039;s all going to be saved in here.

Then finally, Slack also allows you to hold phone calls so you don&#039;t even need to use Skype. You can be chatting to someone using text and then if you want to launch a call with them, you can just click Call and it will launch a call. You can even do video calls and you can even do group calls with multiple people. You get my point. This thing is really good. If it keeps you out of your email inbox, it&#039;s going to be helpful for productivity and everything. So when it comes to team communications and calls, we use Slack.

Then when it comes to file sharing and collaboration, we&#039;ve covered this earlier. We covered it in detail in week four in the assembling your war machine training. If you haven&#039;t seen that, go back and watch it now. We told you how to set up Google Suite, which is Consulting.com/GSuite, basically, what G Suite is is it&#039;s a Google product for businesses. It allows you to have Google Drive, Google Docs, Google Calendar, Gmail, everything set up on your own business domain. That&#039;s something which you would have set up in week four.

So when it comes to file sharing, collaboration, all of that stuff, we use Google Docs a lot. We use Google Docs all the time. We don&#039;t even use Dropbox. We just use Google Drive because we just want to have everything in one place. That&#039;s why you probably noticed a lot of different things throughout this program have been in Google Drive and Google Suite.

So I don&#039;t want anyone looking at all of these things and thinking that they need to use them all because that&#039;s not true at all. Chances are, you don&#039;t even need to use most of these things. I&#039;m just sharing with you all of the different tools that I&#039;ve found to help me and maybe one or two of them is going to help you, maybe none of them, but I just wanted to share for all of these different things what tools I would recommend.

Then when it comes to screenshots and screen recordings, I&#039;ve found the best way to communicate with clients and contractors most of the time is just to quickly record my screen and speak and then send it to them. A lot of the times, it&#039;s too hard to write something with text. It&#039;s so hard to say something in words sometimes. It&#039;s just easier to just show them. We can do that when we record our screen.

So we can use ScreenFlow, which is the application which I recommend using when you&#039;re making all of your videos, your value video and everything like that. It&#039;s a very high quality screen recording software. However, we want something a bit faster and a bit lower quality when it comes to sharing things quickly because we&#039;re not exactly looking for the best highest quality video.

So if you go to Consulting.com/Snagit, this tool here is badass and you can get a free trial of it. I&#039;ll show you how it works. It&#039;s like a screenshot tool pretty much on steroids. Let&#039;s say I want to take a screenshot of something and I want to send it to someone. Well, I go up to here in my menu bar and I click on the Snagit thing, this is. Then I click the Capture button. Now I can take a screenshot of the thing I want to take a screenshot of. So I could just go, bam.

Now, I can either choose to record a video or take a photo. So I&#039;m just going to click Take A Photo. It&#039;s going to take a photo of it. Now, I can edit it. I might just add an arrow on it and I might just say ... I might just point to something, then I might put some text on it. I might say, &quot;Fix this thing. It&#039;s broken.&quot; You can just type. Then what you can do, watch how fast this is, you can just click Share Google Drive and just waiting, waiting, waiting. Bam! Now, it&#039;s shared.

Now, what happens if i go back in here, if I copy/paste this link, it&#039;s already shared this online in my Google Drive account. So all I need to do is drop that link to my contractor or my client and they can see a screenshot with something written over the top of it. It&#039;s really good for sharing screenshots of things and animating things on top of it.

Now, you&#039;ll know what I mean if you&#039;ve been communicating with contractors and clients before in the past. You just need something that works fast. I&#039;ve never seen anything as fast as Snagit. I could take a screenshot, edit it and share it to my Google Drive and paste the link in less 15 seconds or something. Not only that, you can do a video too. If I click on this, Capture, I might select the whole screen. Click on Video, record and now it&#039;s recording my screen, so it&#039;s recording everything I&#039;m doing now. Then if I go back up here and I go stop recording, it&#039;s processing it. So now, it&#039;s recorded my screen here. Now, I&#039;m going to click on Share Google Drive. Bam! It&#039;s already done.

So now if I go into my computer and to my browser, paste that link, just like that, it&#039;s created a screen recording of what I just did, exported the screen recording and uploaded it to Google Drive in 10 seconds. Now, what right now Google Drive is just processing the video, but I can already send that link to someone that fast.

With ScreenFlow, we have to record the screen and then we have to export it, which can take a while. Then once it&#039;s exported, we then have to upload it to something like Wistia or something, then it take even longer. Then it has to process in Wistia and then we have to get the link and then send it to the person. That just takes way too long. If you use Snagit, it&#039;s just that fast. Google hasn&#039;t processed the video yet, but that&#039;s fine because by the time the client opens the email or whatever, I mean, it&#039;s going to be loaded anyway. Sometimes it just takes one or two minutes for it to do its work there, but you get the point.

So Snagit is an absolute beast of it all when it comes to sending screenshots and quick recordings of your screen to your contractors and your clients. I highly recommend it. So that&#039;s Consulting.com/Snagit.

Now, logins and passwords. You&#039;re going to notice that you start to have a lot of logins and a lot of passwords for different software applications and when you&#039;re dealing with different clients, if they&#039;re giving you logins to different things. I mean, it all adds up. So you need to have some system to manage this stuff. I highly recommend LastPass. You can go to Consulting.com/LastPass. You can create a free account.

What LastPass is is it&#039;s a password saving tool. If you go to anything and you want to login, it will remember your password. So I can click up here. If I click on Open My Vault, here&#039;s all of my different things that is saved in here. I&#039;ve got 95 different passwords that are all saved inside of LastPass. Now, what LastPass enables you to do is if I need to share a login with anyone on my team, well, I can just share it within LastPass. So that is the tool that I would highly recommend for logins and passwords.

So that is the project management software stack. It&#039;s a lot of different stuff. Chances are, you don&#039;t need half of it. I just wanted to show you all the different tools because I know for different people watching, different things are going to make sense or at some time in the future of your consulting business career, one of these tools is going to add a tremendous amount of value to you.

Now, for 10x productivity hacks and the power of deep work. So with your new decentralized consulting model, workflows and software stack, your consulting business is going to be operating in the top 1% of businesses out there today. Seriously, this is the top 1% of the top 1%. I&#039;ve seen pretty decent consulting businesses and they still have no idea what they&#039;re doing.

You go in there and they&#039;re still using some archaic email system or they don&#039;t even know how to use Google Drive or Dropbox or anything. They don&#039;t know how to create workflows. They&#039;re still using pen and paper for most thing. I mean, if you know how to do these things which I taught you in this video, you are operating at the top 1% of businesses out there today. So you should be proud about that.

It&#039;s not just about the structure, the processes, the software and the tools. If it was just about that stuff, it would be too easy. So it&#039;s not just about that and you don&#039;t want to get fooled by these things. You don&#039;t want to think that just having all these awesome processes and software and tools is going to make you a lot of money. It can help you make a lot of money, but it isn&#039;t the cause of making a lot of money.

There&#039;s something that&#039;s far more important and that is your ability to focus. So let&#039;s discuss some hacks to get in the zone and focus on your work. So these are some 10x productivity hacks that I&#039;ve provided you with.

So you can have all the knowledge in the world, as well as the best tools and still fail miserably as a consultant. I see this happen all the time. I see people with the shiniest gear, the best tools and a huge amount of knowledge in their head, but they just can&#039;t get any of it applied.

So the most important thing you can possess is a steel-cutting laser-like focus, so a focus that can just cut steel. It&#039;s that intense. That is the most dangerous skill you can have. Here&#039;s some pro tips. Pro tip number one is to block out entire days to work on specific tasks. Don&#039;t multitask. An example, if you&#039;re doing sales and service delivery, that&#039;s what most start out consultants are going to be doing, they&#039;re going to be selling and doing service delivery for the clients which they&#039;ve already sold, all right?

Well, you don&#039;t want to mix all of that up. You don&#039;t want to be doing selling then service delivery then selling then service delivery within one day. That&#039;s crazy. Your head is going to explode and you&#039;re going to ruin your brain. Your brain isn&#039;t supposed to do stuff like that.

So what you want to do instead is dedicated entire days to specific tasks. so I&#039;d recommend something like selling Monday to Wednesday. So Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, all you do is sell. You don&#039;t touch any email. You don&#039;t touch any support. You don&#039;t touch any projects or service delivery or anything. All you are doing is selling. Then on Thursday and Friday, you&#039;re not doing any selling anymore. Now, all you&#039;re doing is delivering, service delivery. Start learning to block out entire days.

It takes your brain three hours to get into gear. So when I start working on something in the morning, let&#039;s say I start at 9:00, my brain isn&#039;t really into gear until 12:00. Now, I&#039;m doing work and it&#039;s all happening and everything, but I&#039;m not in the zone until three hours of focusing on the same thing.

Now, that&#039;s one of the secrets that I&#039;ve got to being able to really focus and do some really powerful work. It&#039;s that I wake up, workout and everything, then I start my day and I work on one thing and one thing only for the whole day. So I might be creating content from 8 a.m. in the morning until about 9 p.m. at night and that&#039;s it. Then the next day, same again. Next day, same again and only one day a week do I actually do anything that isn&#039;t just dedicated to one day.

My Mondays are for just going into the office and doing random tasks like email, phone calls, different errands and then the rest of my week is dedicated to focus. So you want to start doing that.

Now, pro tip number two, never start your day by checking social media, email, et cetera. You want to dive straight into your work and don&#039;t get distracted for the entire day. So I see people do this all the time. They start their day, they get to the office and the first thing they do is load up Gmail. Wrong. Do not touch that thing. The first thing they do is they log in to Facebook. Don&#039;t do it. Don&#039;t log in to any of that stuff. Keep out of there. You want to go straight into the task that you want to complete for the day.

The way your mind works is when you sleep, it gets all refreshed and everything. Then in the morning, the first thing you do is going to set the pattern for the rest of the day. So if the first thing you do is social media and email, all you&#039;re going to do for the rest of the day is click on social media and email because your brain, it just can&#039;t get out of that pattern. It&#039;s just stuck wanting to do that. So that&#039;s the worst thing you can do for it.

If you wake up and you want to just deliver on someone&#039;s project or do sales, that&#039;s all you should do all day. Don&#039;t touch anything else. Then check social media and everything at the end of the day or don&#039;t even check it at all.

Pro tip number three is to learn to fall in love with your work, not the byproducts of your work. So if you don&#039;t absolutely love doing what you&#039;re doing, then you&#039;ll never be able to focus and develop mastery. What I mean by this is a lot of people, they&#039;re so obsessed with the results and the money that they&#039;re going to make that they can&#039;t enjoy the work because when they&#039;re working on the stuff, all they can think about is the results and they&#039;re like, &quot;I just want the results now.&quot; So it&#039;s a really bad thing to do.

The people who focus on results don&#039;t get results. I mean, we want to set goals and we want to know what we&#039;re aiming for and everything. Once we&#039;ve set it, we pretty much need to forget about it and focus on the work because the only thing that&#039;s going to get us the result is the work. So you need to set your goals and then fall in love with the work because if you don&#039;t fall in love with the work, then you&#039;re never going to get the goal. That&#039;s really the secret to it.

I learned this from Michael Jordan of all people. Michael Jordan says, &quot;The way to become the best basketball player in the world is to fall in love with the game because if you fall in love with the game, then you&#039;re going to be practicing all the time and you&#039;re going to be training all the time and you&#039;re not even going to be thinking about it. You just love doing it so you&#039;re just doing it. If you find a spare moment of time anywhere, you&#039;re going to do it.&quot;

So without even noticing it, you&#039;re practicing and you&#039;re doing the work. Then before you know it, you&#039;ve become the best in the world. That&#039;s really how it happens. No one who goes out and wants to be the best in the world really becomes the best in the world without falling in love with the process and without falling in love with the work.

So make it one of your goals to fall in love with the work that you do. Love learning, love working with your clients, doing sales calls, all of this stuff because if you don&#039;t like it and if you don&#039;t love it and if you see it as a task and a burden, well, you&#039;re never going to get anywhere.

A real focus that I&#039;ve adopted is spirit not scoreboard. This is actually what Michael Jordan&#039;s team had, the Bulls, back when they were the best in the world. They would focus on spirit not scoreboard. When they were playing games and everything, they wouldn&#039;t worry about the scoreboard. They&#039;ll just make sure that their own spirit and their team spirit was high because they knew if their team spirit was high and if their spirit was high that they were going to win and get a high scoreboard, but if they focus on the scoreboard, quite often, they would lose their spirit and then they couldn&#039;t actually improve the scoreboard.

So you see how this works? We care about the scoreboard, but in order to care about it, we need to not care about it, if that makes any sense to you at all. Hopefully, it does because that really is the secret to pretty much life. So you want to achieve something, but the way to achieve it is to not focus on it. It&#039;s to focus on the process that generates the result. That&#039;s how you do it.

Now, pro tip number four, go dark to get things done. So if you have a deadline or a big project to deliver on, remove yourself from the world. Stay inside, turn off your phone and don&#039;t touch email or social media and don&#039;t come back to reality until the project is done. This is the most effective strategy that I know of and it&#039;s one of my secret weapons.

So when I need to get things done, I pretty much disappear. I don&#039;t go into the office. I work from home and I just wake up, go to my computer, work, go to sleep, wake up, go to my computer, work, go to sleep. I don&#039;t touch my phone. I don&#039;t touch social media. I don&#039;t touch email. I don&#039;t touch anything. People are emailing me and stuff and I&#039;m not replying. People are messaging me, I&#039;m not doing anything. I don&#039;t even know they exist and my phone is off or in airplane mode.

Yes, things do pile up and yes, some people do get pissed off, but it&#039;s all worth it because I got to do what I needed to do. So you&#039;ve got to learn to do these things if you really want to get 10x productivity out. If you multitask, if you do multiple things, if you mix your days up with all sorts of different stuff, if you start your day with email or social media or if you don&#039;t like doing the work but you see it as an annoying thing that you have to do in order to make money and if you don&#039;t remove yourself from the world, then you&#039;re never going to be able to achieve anything great.

I mean, you might be able to do some average things. You might be able to stumble by and make a few dollars, but you&#039;re never going to achieve any form of greatness. So these four tips will allow you to really feed the fire and become great at what you do. These tips here are more important and more powerful and more potent than anything else in this training module today.

So I showed you different workflows and stuff. Those help a lot. I showed you how to decentralize your consulting business. Now, that is huge. I showed you all of the software and everything. That can help, but nothing is going to be as powerful and as potent as focus. So remember that and remember to structure your days like this. I would print this sheet out on the screen right now. I&#039;ve included it beneath this video on the resources section for download.

You want to implement this. Make it your duty to implement this into your life every single day. I can promise you, you&#039;re going to see some massive results from it. So remember to starve your mind of distractions and feed the focus and follow these tips. So that&#039;s it for this training video today. Thanks for tuning in and I will see you in the next one right now.
