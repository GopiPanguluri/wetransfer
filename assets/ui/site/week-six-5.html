                        Hey, everyone. Sam Ovens here and welcome to this training module called Finance and Cash Flow Mastery. In this module, I’m going to explain how to really manage your finances within your business. This is something which I’ve noticed that pretty much everyone who’s teaching online training or teaching people how to make money or start a business just skips over. It’s pretty crazy because if you don’t know how to manage your finances within your business, then you’re either, A, going to end up in a lot of trouble or, B, you’re going to end up very stressed because you’re going to have a huge mess and you’re going to have to clean it all up or, C, you’re not going to make any money. It’s never really going to end very well for you if you don’t understand the finances and the cash flows within your business.

I know from observing at my most successful students, they’re the ones that really have a grasp on this stuff. This is the thing that really makes that difference between the people who really succeed and the people who just succeed okay. This is one of the most important skills you can have once you start to make money because it’s not how much money you make, it’s how much money you keep. I’ve seen a lot of millionaires lose all of their millions, and it’s because they really don’t know how to manage this stuff.

In this training program, I decided to really explain how it all works and explain how to keep your finger on the pulses of your finances. When you’re able to do this, life will become a lot more easy, business will become a lot more easy, a lot less stressful, and you&#039;ll make a lot more money. With that being said, let&#039;s get started with today’s training.

Here’s what we’re going to cover. First off, it’s not how much you make; it’s how much you keep. I’m going to explain this concept. I’m going to explain really something that’s quite controversial which is that it’s harder to keep money than it is to make it, and I’ll back that up with a whole bunch of things which proves that. It really is harder to keep money that it is to make it. This is the problem that most people don’t understand.

Then I’m going to teach you some financial basics. Things like how to setup your company, how to structure your bank accounts, your credit cards, if you’ve got debit cards, and how to keep your receipts and things like that so just some bare basics; things that you absolutely must be doing.

Then we’re going to go into some financial discipline things. These are some rules to live by each day. We’re going to really adopt these basic disciplines day to day to make sure that we’re going to have our finances in order and we’re going to run our businesses properly. If you do these things each day, then you should never really run into an issue.

Then we’re going to kick it up a notch and discuss how we can corporate raid our own company. Corporate raiding is a strategy that a lot of billionaires use when they buy stock in other people’s companies and they come in and they take over them and then they restructure them. We’re not doing that but we’re going to look at our businesses through the eyes of a corporate raider and think what’s inefficient in our business, what can we raid within our own business. It’s a very good viewpoint to adopt when you’re looking at your business and managing it, and it’s one thing that I do to my company all the time.

Then finally, I’m going to show you the software stack for accounting so the tools that help. It’s just a very simple, I think we’ve got three tools, so three easy-to-use software tools that you can implement in your business so that you can keep your financials, your cash flows, and accounting, and all that stuff all up to par so let&#039;s get started.

At this stage of the program, you know how to start your own consulting business, you know how to get clients, manage clients, and make money. Making money isn’t the only thing. You need to be able to keep it. While this might sound like a stupid thing to say, most people who make money spend the same amount of money and they end up with zero. Pretty much everyone who makes more just somehow ends up spending more and they always end up at the same point. This is because they know nothing about finance, accounting, and cash flow management. This training module is going to show you everything you need to know when it comes to managing your finances as a consultant so let&#039;s get to work.

First of all, it’s not how much you make; it’s how much you keep. Now, if someone could make a billion dollars but if their expenses were a billion dollars then it’s useless; they got zero. Someone who made $100 is worth more than someone who makes a billion if they’re expenses are a billion. It’s not how much you make; it’s how much you keep. Here’s something that will blow your mind: 62% of the Forbes rich list is self-made. Every year, more self-made billionaires make the list compared to billionaires who inherit. How can this be? There’s being so many years and decades of extremely wealthy families, why aren&#039;t they just occupying the whole rich list? Why is it mostly self-made? Why are there more self-made people than there are just people who inherited it? Because it’s easy for the guys who inherited it; they just got it and then they’re on the list but they’re not, so how can this be?

Here’s the truth: It’s harder to manage and keep money than it is to make it. It’s harder to keep the money that you make and manage it and grow it than it is to make it in the first place. This is the truth that most people don’t understand. They think it’s just about making it but then they make more and they wonder why they still have none. It’s because it’s about managing it and keeping it. It’s not about how much you make; it’s about how much you keep.

Most people believe that once they make money, things will be fine where in reality that’s just the beginning. Here’s where most people go wrong. Where most people go wrong with finances? Most people start making money with their business but they don’t keep things clean and organized. They have receipts everywhere, expenses on personal and business accounts and no idea what their profit is. Most people don’t know how accounting works and they misjudge their true earnings and taxes, et cetera.

I see people they don’t even have a business account. Sometimes they just run it all on their personal account. Then when it comes to their personal account, they’ve got three different bank accounts and four different credit cards; what a mess. Then they’ve got two PayPals and they’ve got one setup with the Hotmail, one setup with the Gmail; it’s just out of control. Then most people don’t even know how accounting works. You ask them, “Hey, do you know how much your gross profit or your net profit or something?” and they just look at you sideways like they don’t even know what you’re talking about. It’s because online the whole online world is just distorted with people who don’t know anything about money but they just know a lot about marketing so their brains are wobbly. It means that they can make a lot but they always end up blowing a lot, and that always means that they end up with zero. These people don’t know what their true earnings are. They never know what their profit is, and they never know what their tax liability or anything is either. They always end up getting into trouble.

Most people leave accountings over the last minute when they’re forced to file taxes. At that time, it takes them two to three weeks to figure everything out. This is not only irresponsible but it’s stressful and time consuming. Most people believe that all the magic is in the selling and the marketing of things and not the financial management. That’s not true. The smartest and most successful business people master both. They know how to do the marketing, they know how to do the selling, and they know how to do the finances. They’re good at all of them. It’s like Michael Jordan. He wasn’t just a good shooter; he was good at everything. Most basketball players just focus on one strength but Jordan had all of them. This kind of power is like in business too. You want to have one thing that you’re really good at but you want to be able to do some other things as well.

Most people spend the money they make on personal expenses like house, TVs, alcohol, vacations, et cetera. While this might give you some short-term satisfaction, it will deliver you long-term pain. There’s honestly a smarter way to live. Most people think that the reason why they’re making money is so that they can buy a fancy car or a bigger TV or go out or go on a vacation or whatever. If you start just doing this with all the money you make, then you’re going to end up on a treadmill and you’re not going to be able to get off it. There’s a better way to live, and I’m going to show you a lot of different hacks when it comes to finances in this module.

Let&#039;s start with the basics, the financial basics, so your company, your accounts, your cards, and receipts.

Let&#039;s start with the basics so that we can get those setup correctly and then move on to some of the more advanced stuff. Here’s the financial basics for running a consulting business.

First of all, make sure you register your business officially and operate as a company, not an individual. We covered this in week 4’s Assembling the War Machine. You should set up your businesses in LLC or you should talk to a lawyer and figure out what the best thing to do is, but it’s pretty much always better to set up as an LLC than it is to run without a business at all. I strongly recommend setting up an official business, registering it properly, and then operating as a business, not a person.

You want to have two separate bank accounts. They can both be with the same bank like you could go to Chase or you could go to Wells Fargo or whatever and you can open two accounts with the same bank; one, you want to have for personal, and the other, you want to have for business. One would be called Sam Ovens and the other would be called Sam Ovens Consulting LLC. Within those separate bank accounts, you want to have a personal and a checking for yourself. For yourself, you want to have a checking and a savings. A savings is where you’re going to put your savings, and the checking is where your day-to-day expenses and things are going to be. The one that’s connected to your debit card or whatever that’s going to be your checking account. Then your savings account isn’t connected to a checking account or a card at all; that’s how it works, nice and simple like that.

Then with your business, you want to have a checking and a savings account as well; just two accounts, keep it simple. The checking one is the one that’s attached to the debit card or the credit card. Then the savings is one that isn’t and so you put the bulk of your cash, if you have any, in the savings and then you have the operating line and the checking. You just want to keep it simple like that.

Then you want to have two separate debit or credit cards. If you use credit cards, that’s fine. Just make sure you’ve got two separate ones or if you use debit cards, just have two separate ones. You want to have a personal card and a business card. When you go out and you buy things that are personal expenses, you use the personal card, so that’s things that have nothing to do with the business. However, if it has something to do with the business and you can expense it, put it on the business card. If you just stick to this, then your finances are never going to be messy. It gets messy when you start mixing these two things up. You start putting personal on the business and business on the personal. Now, it becomes a real problem to try and figure out where the money is and file any taxes or do your accounts or whatever so just keep it on separate accounts.

You want to put all business expenses on the business card and all personal on the personal card, and those are two separate accounts. Then whenever you sign up for anything business-related, use your business email, and then store receipts in a receipts folder. In week 4, Assembling the War Machine, you would have set up your G Suite account with Google. That would have given you your own business email like <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="7300121e3300121e1c05161d0017161e1c5d101c1e">[email&#160;protected]</a>, something like that.

When you sign up for things, software or whatever, you want to use your business email, because what will happen is when they send you a receipt and everything, it will go into that business email. Then you want to create a folder in Gmail and you just want to call it receipts. Then every time you get a receipt via email, just drag it into that receipts folder. That way, whenever you have to come back and look for receipts if you have to, you can just search in your inbox and you’re going to find it and you know which folder it’s into, and this will make life a lot easier. It’s just a really simple thing to do that will shave hours off all other stuff.

Then keep all of your physical business receipts and store them in a dedicated drawer. These days, you shouldn’t even get many of these things. I get hardly any but sometimes you get the odd one and it’s not an online receipt. When you get one of these, you always want to keep it. It’s a good discipline to live by. Whenever you get one, just keep it. Put it in your wallet and then when you get home, just put it in a drawer and just forget about it. Just put it in that drawer and forget about it. You want to dedicate a particular drawer to business receipts. Then once every now and then, you just go in and you grab them all and then you can just put them away somewhere. Now, we don’t really need to care about looking through them or anything. We just want to save them there in case we need them when we’re doing our accounts or something like that.

The key is to keep it simple and minimal. With all of these things I’ve got in the screen here, it’s all about keeping it simple. You only use one card, one account, one merchant, one email, and the less, the better. When it comes to your personal accounts, you should just have one bank account and you should only have one credit card or one debit card. Do not go and get a whole bunch of different stuff. It just makes a mess. With your business, same thing, one account, one card. It makes it real simple. When I open my wallet, there’s just two cards in it: personal and business; that’s it. If then if I log in to my online banking, it’s just personal checking, personal savings, business checking, business savings; that’s it so it’s simple.

Then I only have one merchant which is Stripe, we got you to sign up for a Stripe account in week 4’s Assembling the War Machine; that’s it, very simple. Then one email; I only have one email address. I only have to log in to one thing. I only have to remember to go in to one thing. It’s very simple. I’ve got a very big business right now that does a lot of stuff, but I still only have one of these things. The lesson here is keep it simple; the less, the better.

Now let&#039;s talk about some financial disciplines and rules to live by each day. Now that we’ve got the basics covered, let&#039;s talk about financial discipline. You want to check your bank account daily, and always keep a realistic view on your financial position. I find that a lot of people are too afraid to look at their bank accounts. Whenever this happens, that means trouble. You don’t want to ever just fool yourself, and that’s what really those people do. It’s like they don’t want to look at their account because then things become realistic. Then they see how much they’ve got and then they get sad or whatever so they just shut it out and they forget. You don’t want to do that. That’s like sweeping things under the rug. You want to look at it every day because it will light a fire onto your ass to do something about it. You always want to keep a realistic view on it a sec. You don’t want to think things are good if they’re not. What is the point in that? You want to know the truth. Every day, get into the habit of checking it and to check what expenses went out and check what things came in, because that way, you’re always keeping your eye on the ball. You’re always seeing what’s going with your money, and you’re never going to miss a beat.

Then you want to keep all of your business receipts and store them in an email folder or drawer. We’ve already covered that one. When you make money, just let it sit in the business account; don’t move it, don’t spend it. A lot of people, as soon as they make some money, they are in a hurry to spend it on a car or some shit, and honestly, they’re so stupid. Don’t do that; just let it sit. Practice your discipline. Because when money starts coming into your account, you want to do all sorts of things with it, and you just want to sit still and you want to observe your mind as it races. Your mind is going to start hanging around. It’s like what could we buy? We could buy this, this, this, and then you just want to watch the mind just go. Then as you watch it and observe and do anything, it will calm down. Once it’s calm down, then you can get back to work and make some more. Don’t feel an urge to spend it. You just want to let it pile up.

Then learn to see your money not as money but as a war chest. That’s there to help you make even more money, not buy things. This was a massive shift in mindset and thinking about money. I used to make money so that I could buy things. That’s what I did because when I was younger, I need … If my mom gave me 10 bucks, that meant I could get a sausage roll and some other things from the [tech 00:18:42] shop. Immediately, when I saw 10 bucks, I pretty much saw a sausage roll because that’s what it was. Then when I got older, if I saw 20 bucks, it just looked like a box of beers. Then as I got even older, it looks like pretty much just more beers or other things. It never looked like anything else other than things I could buy.

As I started to make more and more, I started noticing that I still had none because I just keep buying things. It was like I was always on a treadmill. You don’t want to do this because it ends up just not being very fun at all. It ends up being miserable and then you end up getting so distracted with all these crap that you’ve bought that you can’t even make any money because you’ve got too much stuff going on.

The big change in thinking I had was I switched from thinking of money as something to buy things and then I turned it into … I call it now a war chest. A war chest is like the amount of money you’ve got for battle. In war times, a country had a war chest and it’s how much cash they had, and that’s how much weapons they could buy and everything to defeat their opponent in war. I think about my money as a war chest to hire people to invest in ads, to build great programs, to just have the best tools and the best equipment for my team, to be able to look after my team, to be able to look after myself, to invest in myself and my education and everything. That’s how I look at my money. I don’t look at it as a way to buy things. I don’t care about things. I just want to keep getting better. I look at my money now as a war chest to fuel my mission. If I was spending it on stupid things like cars, then I wouldn’t have a war chest, and then I wouldn’t be able to win in war and then I’d lose. The whole point wasn’t to buy a Ferrari; the whole point was to start a business. Don’t get confused on this. Treat your money as a war chest.

One thing you&#039;ll learn and this is coming from someone who is being one of these idiots before is that poor people buy fancy cars so that they can look rich and smart people re-invest the money in their business. This is a funny story. We know as poor I always thought the rich people had fancy cars. Then as soon as I made enough money to buy a fancy car, I bought a fancy car but then when I did that, I didn’t really have that much money anymore. Then I was driving around in my fancy car thinking, man, everyone thinks that I’ve got a lot of money because I’ve got this fancy car, but I know really that I don’t actually have that much so felt a bit fake.

Then at the same time, a lot of the actual rich people I met like real rich people, I’m talking hundreds of millions not just some small amount of money, not like 5 million, not 10, not 20. We’re talking about hundreds of millions, real money. When I started to meet those people, they never had fancy cars or if they did, they were only for racing on tracks or things. That’s when I really realized that rich people don’t try to look rich. They try to look less rich. People who are poor try to look rich. It’s the opposite of what you think. Anyone who tries to look rich probably isn’t, because they’re trying to compensate for something. Anyone who is trying to look not rich, well, they probably are very rich. It’s a very interesting thing to observe. Anyone that has a car in their photo where they’re always showing cars and stuff, they’re probably not very rich. It’s probably more of a front and a facade. This is the thing I learned is that rich people do not take photos with cars ever, and they don’t do things like that because that’s what poor people do because they want to look rich. It’s a way of trying to put up a façade.

When you learn this, hopefully, you won’t go through the same mistakes and fakery that I went through when I just made a little bit of money and was so eager to look like a hotshot. Now, I didn’t make any decent money and by a decent money I mean like 10, 20 million plus until I forgot about all of this stuff. I forgot about looking rich and I just worry about doing good work and that’s what you want to do. Forget about what you look like; just focus on actually being it and achieving it. Who cares what you look like? One is an image; the other is a reality.

You want to re-invest the money you make in your business. When you start doing this, the thing starts snowballing out of control. When you keep taking it out all the time to fund a vacation or partying or a car, then it’s going to disappear. I’ve met many people who have made many millions and spent it all and they have nothing so don’t fall for this trap.

You want to keep track of your monthly income and expenses at all times so that you can forecast things and know your true financial position so that you can make better decisions and investments. To help you do this, I’ve provided a financial tracking sheet. This is the financial tracking sheet right here. You want to use this spreadsheet to track your monthly income and expenses as well as forecast and keep track of your cash flows. This is available in the resources section for download. Let&#039;s say Excel file and you can download it, open it up, and then I suggest opening it in Google Docs and using it in your computer. To do that, you just click on this blue link.

Here it is. It’s called financial tracking sheet. Down the bottom, you&#039;ll see these tabs, so it has 2017 cash flows, 2017 line items, then 2018 cash flows, 2018 line items, and then business expenses, and then personal expenses. Those are the different tabs and now I’m going to explain all of this to you as we go along. Just checking back here. Cool.

Where do we get started with this? First of all, I put two years here just because I didn’t want to just provide 2017. I wanted to provide 2018 as well. Until we’re in 2018, just forget about it. You’re going to start off with 2017. In here, we go to the line items first. This is where we start. Then what you want to do is you want to find the month where we’re at in the current year. Let&#039;s say we’re in January 2017, right?

What you want to do is every month you want to look at your bank statement for your company account and then you want to put all of your income expenses here one by one. Let&#039;s say I paid for Namecheap and it cost me 12 bucks. I put it in just like that. Sorry. What I did just there was the income so Namecheap would go in expense. You’d write Namecheap, 10 bucks. You just list all of your expenses here. Now, if you need more lines because you’ve got a lot of expenses or a lot of income, you can just go insert one above, insert one below. You can just add more lines, right? I’m sure everyone knows how to do that.

That’s what you do. You plot all of your expenses. Each day when you check on your accounts, you want to plot this in. This will be tracking your expenses and then you also want to track your income. Whenever someone pays you, put it in here. You might say XYZ Company invoice 1; let&#039;s say that was the item. Then they paid us 2 grand. That’s the income. You want to list all the line items here. Now, what this basically is it’s a summary of your bank statement for the month. We’ve got all of the different income items and then all of the different expense items. Why we have it here instead of just looking at our bank statements is that this is a cleaner version. We’ve just got the summary here and we can just scroll across and see all of the months, and then we can also see the profit and loss for each one. This just makes it a lot easier. Trust me, you want to use this thing. It will help you immensely.

Then each month, you just go through and you plot your expenses, you plot your income, right? As simple as that. Then it will total up automatically your expenses and your income and it will tell you whether you made a profit or a loss for that particular month; as simple as that.

Then what you want to do is you always want to forecast your cash flows. You can see on this one here, 2017 cash flows, we’ve got these months across here: January, February, March, April, May, et cetera, all the way across to the end of the year, December. You can see these two columns; there’s expected and actual. Expected is our forecast at the beginning of the month. That’s where we see how financial goes. Actual is what we actually did at the end of the month. It’s always good to forecast these things, because all good businessmen are good at forecasting expense and income. We never get it right. No one ever forecasts accurately to the dollar. That’s stupid because it never happens. No one can do that, but you want to still be able to predict and forecast and you want to know whether you’re way out all the time or you’re way under all the time.

You want to know how accurate your predictions are so that when you have to go and make financial decisions, you know whether you can or you can’t. You want to start learning how good your ability is to forecast your incoming expense, because most people, they forecast their income sky high. They think their expenses are going to be pretty much nothing. Then at the end of the month, it’s the opposite way. Their income is zero and their expenses are high. This is because this person is never built up any financial disciple. They’ve never actually looked at things. They’re just dreamers. You just want to keep track of this stuff.

Let&#039;s say we’re in January of 2017 and we’re at the start of the month. What you do here is you put in your offer, your offers on the left hand column. Let&#039;s say I have one offer and it’s called Facebook ads management. The price for that is, let&#039;s say the price is 3,000. Then let&#039;s say I have a second offer … Let&#039;s actually say I don’t have a second … Oh, we’ll do another one and we’ll just call this one FB ads management and we’ll just put in brackets, advanced. You don’t want to have too many offers you want to focus. Then let&#039;s say this one is $5,000, right? Just to tiers of service on thing.

Now, I’m going to forecast that I’m going to make three sales of this and one sale of this in the coming month. You want to just guess here. You want to base this off strategy sessions, your conversion rates, all of that stuff. You want to make a forecast. This is in the expected column. If I sell three of this at 3 grand, that’s 9 and one of this at five, that’s 5; that’s a total of 14,000 income which automatically calculates.

Then if we scroll down here, it has all of our different expenses. What we do is we categorize our expenses into this different chart of accounts. This will work for pretty much everyone. This is honestly what I still use in my business. It’s as simple as this. I keep it really simple. How this works is you want to go to your business expenses tab and you want to list all the different expenses that you have that are re-occurring in your business. To do this, you just want to pull up the last two or three months of your bank statement and look through it and look to see which things you always get charged for or which things you’re always paying for.

Most people in this training, they’re going to be paying for ClickFunnels and G Suite and then they might be paying for some Facebook ads and they might buy a few books on Amazon or online course. Their bank might charge them a small fee each month. They might have insurance for their business, might have a virtual assistant, and then here’s these other things that most people don’t understand is that you can calculate a certain amount of your home as an office and you can charge it as office rent. If half of your house is dedicated to the business, then half of your rent, you can charge to the business and that would go in here as home office rent.

Then if you’re using the Internet pretty much solely for business, then you can just put the home office Internet on here and half of home office power. If you work from home, most of what you do is business and most of what you use the house for is business then, you can expense it or probably half of it. You can put offices expenses here or if you have a physical office, you can list all the expenses here. Then if you have different staff, you can list them here. This is where they’re full-time employees or part-time employees or virtual assistants, contractors whatever. We just group them all under staff so you can list everyone that works for you here that you pay month to month.

Then software, what different software applications you’re paying for; list them out. Advertising, how much money are you budgeting to spend on Facebook ads; write it in. Learning and development, this is things like books, online courses, seminars, how much are you budgeting for this. Other expense is just things that don’t get categorized into this. It could be things like bank fees, insurance, whatever. Put them in here.

Now, you can see what your total cost is for each expense category. You can see if you’re high in office expenses, high in staff, or high in software, or high in advertising. You can just really look along this line and see where the bloating of your expenses sits. Then you can see your total monthly expenses here.

What we want to do is we want to, once we’ve planned all of these out and we’ve plotted all of our expenses, like I said, this is not exact. This is a forecast and this is we’re having our best attempt at really trying to predict what our monthly expenses are each month. You list that out and then you want to plot these in here for each one. If office expenses was 1,700, I’m going to put in here 1,700. If staff was 2,000, I’ll put that down. Then if software was 100, and advertising 1,000 … that was administration, so administration was … Oh, that&#039;s other expenses, sorry; so that’s 140. Actually, I think I moved administration. This is right. I’ll delete this one here because I didn’t think it was necessary. Advertising, 1,000, learning and development is 1,100, travel which I think I’ve just grouped that into here as well. I just grouped that into other expenses so I’m going to delete this out too. It makes it even more simple for you. Then other expenses, you just have 140, so 6,040 total, 6,040 total.

I’m forecasting here that I’m going to sell three of my Facebook ads management package at 3 grand; that’s going to get me 9. One of my Facebook ads management advanced, that’s going to get me 5 and that’s a total of 14,000. Then I predict this is what my expenses are going to be.

Now, here’s my income; here’s my expense. That means my net cash flow is going to be $7,960 dollars, so I’m going to make that much. Now, here’s where this thing gets cool. You wanted to enter in here your opening bank account balance. If you look at your bank account at the start of the month whenever you start using this thing, what is the available balance? Put that in here. Let&#039;s say I’ve got 20,000, right? At the end of the month, my closing balance is going to be 27,960.

Then this is what I predict. Then I’m going to plot this at the start of the month, January 1st. Then by the end of the month, February 1st or January 31st, I’m going to come in here and I’m going to see what the actual was, and I’m going to plot that in here. Then every month, I’m going to forecast and then I’m going to have actual, forecast, actual, forecast, actual. You get the point? Do this on the first day of the month. Do this on the last day of the month, first day of the month, last day of the month, right? Get in to the habit of doing that.

Then what we want to start observing is how accurate our guesses are. Did we sell more in income or way less and was our expenses way more or way less? We want to start observing this. It’s okay if it differs because each time we forecast, what you&#039;ll notice is your forecast get better. You start to learn and so you start to predict more accurately. Over time, your forecasts get really close to actuals. It really keeps you aware and conscious of your financial situation, and it holds you accountable as well. It shows you this like you’re opening and closing balance. It really makes a huge difference. I can’t recommend using this enough. It will change the game for you. You do this one on the first day of each month; this one in the last day of each month.

We’re also tracking our line items every month. The line items are the things that make this up. This here is an overall summary. It groups all expenses together and it groups all income together. Line items show the individual line items so that’s how it works.

Then the business expenses tab, this is just a summary of our monthly expenses just so we get a rough idea of what we need to make each month to breakeven and what our monthly costs are. It’s very good to know this all the time. It brings a lot of peace into your life when you know what this number is. When you don’t know how much money you need to make each month, you’re in a constant panic because you always think that you’re in trouble, but you might not be or you might be in more trouble than you think you are. That’s why it’s important to have this number and be conscious and aware of it.

Then the final column, the final tab is personal expenses. While this doesn’t have anything really to do with our business, it’s a good idea to keep track of this too. When I started tracking this stuff, it’s when I started getting rich. Before I tracked this stuff, it didn’t matter how much money I made; I just lost it. You want to put in groceries like how much money do you spend on food, insurance, lunches and dinners out, do you have any loans or higher purchase agreements or whatever? Figure out what your monthly costs are as an individual person living on earth. How much money do you consume each month? Figure it out. Then you can start to think how can I cut money out of here? How can I live cheaper than how I currently am? Then you can look at your business expenses and you could start thinking where are things that are a little bit bloated in here? How could I cut a little bit of money out? When you’ve got these things visible, you’re able to improve them, but when they’re not visible, you can’t improve them.

Then here, you can get a really accurate financial position to see how your business is performing throughout the entire year all on one sheet. I can’t tell you how much this spreadsheet will help you. This thing is going to become your best friend. You wanted to make sure you download it, put it into your Google Drive, save it, and I’d even bookmark it. I’d drag this in here and bookmark it just like that, because you’re going to want to refer to this thing all the time to get a clear understanding of what your financial position is. That is the financial tracking sheet.

Now, let&#039;s talk about corporate raiding your own company. Now that you have your financial basics, your daily discipline, and financial tracking sheet in place, it’s time to corporate raid your own business. You might be thinking what does corporate raid mean? Here’s what corporate raiding means. Corporate raiding is when somebody buys huge amounts of shares or stock in a public company and then gains voting rights so that they can influence the board decisions in the direction of the company. What they do is they’re looking at different businesses and they’re like, “Okay, I want to raid this one.” They start buying the stock off the public markets and then once they a certain amount of stock, they’re able to vote and have a lot of say and actually make decisions for the whole company. Then they can tell the company what to do like trim this up, cut the expenses here, or drop this business and focus on this one. They can do things like that.

Corporate raiders, such as Carl Icahn, spend their time looking for flabby businesses that are poorly managed and have too much expense or not aggressive enough with growth. On the left here, there’s an image of Carl Icahn on the front cover of Time and says, “Master of the Universe.” This dude is a financial genius, and I’ve learned a ton from him. This guy has corporate raided companies like the biggest companies you’ve ever heard of in the entire world. This dude is a multi, multi-billionaire. This dude is probably the most powerful corporate raider in the world.

What he does is he looks for flabby businesses. What I mean by flabby is businesses that are poorly run. Their expenses don’t make sense. Their expenses are really high but they’re not contributing it all towards growth, and the business is just screwing around. They’re not focused; they don’t even really know what they’re doing. Carl Icahn doesn’t like buying good companies. He likes buying bad companies that can be turned good. What he does is he looks at companies that are bad, flabby, buys them, then he bullies the board because he’s got so many shares he can get them to do what he wants. Then the board listens to him and makes all the changes and then the company starts performing better because they’ve made the right decisions. Once the company is performing better, the stock price goes up. Then once the stock price goes up, Carl Icahn sales his shares and that’s how he makes money. They buy up shares in the company from the stock market at the current share price and then start dictating management decisions to lift the performance of the business. When the performance lifts, share prices increase, and the corporate raider sells at a profit. That’s how it works.

Now, why am I telling you about this? We’re just doing some consulting here. We’re not out corporate raiding things so why? We want to look at our business through the eyes of a corporate raider. We want to make sure that our own consulting businesses aren&#039;t flabby in any areas. If they are, then we need to start trimming them up. Here’s how we do that. This is how you corporate raid your own business.

Most consultants get lazy with their business and let expenses and complexities stack up over time. This means that the business flabby, inefficient, and do not driven to its full potential. Don’t think all this won’t happen. It happens to everyone. It happens to me, it happens to every single person on earth. It happens to everybody. It’s bound to happen; it’s inevitable. Don’t think that it won’t.

This is what happens: Over time, time brings with it things like additives. It brings things that make things more complex and it makes things flabbier and more inefficient. If we’re not trimming as fast as we’re adding on, then we’re in for some trouble.

What we want to do is we want to keep track of all the financials in our business using the financial tracking sheet provided to you in the resources section. This will show you all expenses and income at month as well as month-to-month performance. Like is said, this is available for download beneath the video. If you use this sheet, then you’re going to have your line items here each month so you know what money did we make last month, well, here it is. What money did we spend last month, well, here it is. Then what were our predictions like? Did I make more than I thought I was going to make or less? Here we go. “Oh, wow, I made quite less than I thought, damn. Maybe I shouldn’t be so optimistic about next month. Maybe I should actually work harder next month because I did worse than I thought I was.” This is the conversations you will start to have with yourself when you start tracking this stuff. This is the stuff that Carl Icahn looks at with companies. He’ll go through the numbers like this and he’ll think, where is this thing flabby? Where is this thing inefficient?

The business expenses list is a good place to start getting an idea of whether a company is flabby especially personal expenses. Most people are too flabby here. Most people have all their expense bloated up here and then nothing in here. It’s bad to have nothing in here, because business expense quite often is an investment to make business income come in. Personal expense is nothing but an absolutely waste. This is where you want to be lean and mean. This here, you don’t want to be too lean and mean. You don’t want to have stupid stuff in here but you don’t want to have nothing, because you need to be spending some money to make some money. Up here, well, we can be as bloated as you want up in your income, but you don’t want to be bloated with office. You want to have no more than really three things, ideally, one thing. You should just be selling a lot of that. That’s where all your money should be coming from. Then you should have nice lean expenses and you should always be making a profit. This is a very, very powerful sheet for helping you corporate raid your own business.

Every few months, you want to spend one to two days going over your business financials in detail looking for any areas where you can trim expense and make it more efficient. You want to do this to your personal expenses too. You don’t need to do this every day, because what I find is that business is kind of run like body builders. What’s interesting about body builders is that they say that you can’t cut and bulk at the same time. I don’t know if that is true. I think you probably can but it’s not the best way to bulk or it’s not the best way to cut, right? It’s like trying to go fast and slow at the same time. It’s probably not the best way to go fast, probably not the best way to go slow. The best way to go slow is to go slow. The best way to go fast is to go fast. The best way to bulk is to bulk and the best way to cut is to cut. That’s how body building works. What happens is these body builders they bulk up and they eat a ton of food and they lift all these heavy weights and everything and they get pretty big. Their muscles get massive.

What happens is they get fat too while they’re doing that. Then they don’t really care about it because they’re bulking. Then what they do is when they get to their bulky size, they then cut and that’s when they start trying to get rid of the fat. They cut down the amount of carbs and everything they’re eating and they do higher reps and not as much intense heavy lifting just to try burn off the fat. When they work in that way, when they bulk and then cut and they bulk and then cut and then bulk and then cut, they get bigger than someone who is trying to bulk and cut at the same time. This is very true with business.

When you’re trying to grow, you can’t be trying to cut. If in your business, if you’re trying to go through a massive growth spike, you can’t be trying to cut expenses at the same time because that doesn’t really work. In order to grow, you need to add expense. In order to reduce expense, sometimes you hurt growth a little bit. That’s how it works.

I like to work in really two-month cycles. I’ll do two months of growing and I’ll the expenses bloat up a bit and get a bit messy. Then after that, I’ll come in and I’ll spend one or two days looking over the financials and I’ll do some cutting, and I’ll trim out the fat. Then we’ll go back into growing again then I’ll come back trim out the fat. It’s good to do this once every few months. You want to do it at the absolutely least like once every six months, because over time as you grow, you’re going to pick up additional flabbiness and you want to trim it off. Then you want to bring on some more flabbiness again. You don’t want to avoid flabbiness all together because that’s how you grow, but you don’t want to leave it one. I’m pretty sure you get what I’m trying to say here. You need flabbiness to grow but then you need to trim it off and then add it on again. You just need to go through those cut and bulking cycles.

You want to do it to your personal expenses too. People have lifestyle creep; the more money they make, the more money they spend. You want to make sure you don’t have that. You want to make sure that the more money you make, you increase your standard of living but it doesn’t get stupid. For example, when I started making like … when I was making like 2 million a year, I lived in this apartment, and now, I’m making a lot more than that like more than 10 times that and I still live in this apartment. Have I ever thought about getting like a ridiculous one? Yes, but I don’t. I could get a fancier watch. I had a Rolex previously when I first moved in here. Now, I have way more money. Could I get a better one? Yes. Have I? No. The furniture is the same. My clothes, they’re the same. I haven&#039;t increased my lifestyle expense but I’ve increased my income because that’s how you get rich. If you’re living in an absolutely shithole, then, yes, you want to improve your standard of living a little bit because you’re not going to think right when you’re in a shithole. You don’t want to increase your expenses every time you make more money. It will come; you want to keep it under control. Don’t let it creep. Keep your hands on it. Keep control of it. Don’t let it get away on you.

Another thing to look for is assets. Assets are things that you own or your business owns that are worth money and this could be anything like cars, TVs, stereos, computers, electronics, all sorts of stuff. You always want to review what assets you and your business own. If they are not being used, liquidate them and use the cash to feed income-generating activities so that you can make more money. This is a big lesson I learned. This is why this financial sheet comes in handy.

What you can do is you can add another tab down the bottom here. You could add this and call it assets. You can have one column called business assets and another called personal assets. What you want to do is list all the things your business owned; it might be laptop, microphone, all this different stuff. Then list all the things you own and list how much money each thing is worth. It’s good to keep your eyes on this stuff because it shows you how much stuff you’ve got and what it’s all worth. Then sometimes you look at it and you’re like, “Oh, wow. I haven&#039;t used this thing in ages and it’s worth that much. Let&#039;s get rid of it.” Because when you get rid of something that you’re not using, your life doesn’t change at all but then you’ve got some cash freed up that you can throw in to advertising or something. If you’re spending money on ads and it’s generating you an ROI of 5:1, that means if I spend a grand, I make 5. That means for every time this stupid asset is sitting in my basement or garage that’s worth like 5 grand, that means I’m missing out on 25 grand every month because of no other reason other than just being an idiot.

What I learned is when I started to see that I could make ROI and everything, I was like, “Shit, I’m selling all of my stuff. Why have a Ferrari? Why have all of this stuff when it just costs me money where if I invested this money wisely, I’d be worth so much?” That’s what I did, I sold everything. Sold my Lamborghini, my Ferrari, my Porsche, my everything; I had too much stuff. It’s because I thought that’s what you did when you make money, you buy stupid shit and I was wrong. When I started selling that stuff and investing it into my business, that’s when I started to become really rich. You always want to keep an eye on those things. If you’re not using an asset that’s worth money, liquidate it. You can always buy it back later.

Here is a huge mindset shift that will help. Instead of seeing your business as a tool to make you money, learn to see it as a tool to make money so that it can make money and cycle the funds around through a feedback loop and scale up. This is huge. If you can understand this, if you can see what I’m trying to get you to see here, then you’re going to have a massive light bulb moment.

Most people just view their business as this is a tool for me to make money and use the money so that my life can be better. It’s a very selfish view. It’s not like that. If you do use it like that, then it’s going to be a pretty shitty tool at generating money. The real difference for me happened when I viewed my business as a tool to make money so that it can make more money. Every amount of money I made then I could use that money, re-invest it and make more and then I could get that money, re-invest it and make more. Then I could get that money, re-invest it and make more and then, oh my god, all of a sudden I’ve got too much money. That’s how it happens.

When I was viewing my business before as a tool that was there for me to buy fancy things, then I made no money really, because I’d make 100 grand, take it out, buy something stupid. Then I’d make another 100 grand, take it out, buy something stupid and I never made any money and the business could never grow because it never had any money in it, and I didn’t want to invest any money in the business because I was just all out for me. I was like, “Me, me, me, me, me. Let&#039;s take the money out of the business.” Now, I don’t take anything out of it and I just feed it. I feed the beast and it just goes and so that’s what you want to do.

Now, let&#039;s discuss the software stack, so the tools that help with accounting and finance and all that. Now, that you’ve got a sound understanding of how to manage your businesses’ financials, it’s time to see the software stack that we use to do our accounting and finances efficiently. Let&#039;s take a look.

The business accounting software stack. When it comes to cash flows, forecasts, and budgets, you only use the financial tracking sheet which is available in the resources section. This thing is seriously good. It will change the game for you. Make sure you track everything in here. Put your like items in here. You should put your forecasts for your cash flows in here, your actuals in here with each month, summarize your business expenses, summarize your personal expenses, have another one for assets. Use this and it will help you immensely. That way, if you ever need to do your taxes or if an accountant needs to see your books or whatever, if all you have is this, they’re going to faint. If you go and see an accountant and he’s like, “Okay, yes, I can help you file your taxes. Do you have any books or anything?” If you show him this, the dude is going to collapse. He’ll be like, “Are you kidding me? You did all of this? This means my job is only going to take about 20 minutes.” This is why we do it. It makes everything easier because no one does this. No one knows how to do it so make sure you use that.

Then when you’re just getting started, I would use this. Then when you’re making more than about 3, 4, 5 grand a month, then you should sign up for an accounting software as well and you want to use both. I still use both because I want to keep … I really understand this thing and it’s simple. I do use the accounting software because it’s the best at compiling financial statements and working with accountants and all that stuff. I still use both and I recommend you use both. Now, you can use two tools QuickBooks or Xero.

If you’re in Australia or New Zealand, Xero is probably the best. If you’re in America, QuickBooks is probably the best. If you’re in another country in the world, probably one of these two is going to work. You can go to consulting.com/quickbooks. Oops. That wasn’t it. It will take you to QuickBooks’ website. You can sign up for a free trial and it’s pretty cheap to use QuickBooks for a small business, 5 bucks a month, all right? Or it might be 5 or 10 bucks a month. Sorry, that’s independent contractors. Small business is going to be 24 bucks a month. It is worth it once you’re making 3 grand or more. If you’re making less, then I wouldn’t worry so much about using a software for financials. I’d just use this spreadsheet because your financials aren&#039;t going to be very complicated. When you do get to 3 grand a month or more, use one of these tools.

Then for receipt management, I like this thing called Shoeboxed. You could go to consulting.com/shoeboxed. This is a really cool tool that you can use. Basically, what happens is every time you get a receipt in your inbox, it saves it into this thing called Shoeboxed. Then when you get receipts in the mail, every month, Shoeboxed sends you one of these magic envelopes. This is what I have in my business receipts drawer. Pretty much, I just shove all these receipts in a drawer and then at the end of the month, I just put them inside the magic envelope and send them to this place. It’s already prepaid and everything. Then they go and scan all of these things and then they upload them into the software and everything so even your paper receipts get put into this thing. Then this means that you’ve got like a database of all of your businesses receipts. You can search them, you can do everything. This way, you never lose anything.

I find that if you track stuff in here, you use a software like QuickBooks and if you use Shoeboxed, you&#039;ll never going to have any problems with your accounts. Even if an accountant needs to look at your books or whatever and help you with stuff, if they see you’re using these three things, they’d going to pretty much cry because it’s just going to be … You’re like their dream client. You want to make sure you use these, but only use this first one if you’re making 3 grand or less a month; above 3 grand a month, use all three of them. That’s how that works. If want to learn more about how to use QuickBooks and Shoeboxed and everything, you should go to their websites. They’ve got tons of trainings, tutorials, all sorts. I’m not going to go and explain in detail how to use these things in this training program, just a brief overview. That is the business accounting software stack.

Now, I will leave you with some final notes on finances and accounting and things. Most entrepreneurs ignore this stuff and think that it isn’t important. Most entrepreneurs think it’s all about making money, it’s all about the marketing, the ads, and all that stuff. Believe me, I used to be one of those guys too. None of those guys have any money seriously. I’ve seen too many successful people make millions of dollars and then waste it all only to end up back at the bottom again. You don’t want to think like this.

What you want to do is you want to make a commitment to keeping accurate financials for your business at all times and start training yourself so that you can apply the daily discipline taught in this training module. My students who have followed this stuff are rich, filthy rich. One of them almost makes a million dollars a month and that’s because he followed this stuff. I have no other student close to that because they haven&#039;t followed this stuff as well.

Mindset shift. Instead of seeing your business as a tool to make you money, learn to see it as a tool to make money so that it can make more money. Cycle those funds through a feedback loop. Stop taking the money out of the business. When you take the money out of a business, you have to pay tax, a personal income tax, and then you’re spending the money and then it’s useless and now it’s gone. Now, you might own something. This is when I really got a wake-up call. I took out 100 something grand to buy a Ferrari in my business. When I took that 100 something grand out, I had to pay like … I forgot how much in taxes like 30% in taxes or something so what’s that? It’s like $35,000 in tax. Really, this Ferrari cost me a lot more. Then I was like, “Damn, I had to pay that money in tax. If I had left it in the business and re-invested it, then I&#039;d probably wouldn’t have to pay it because I would have been leaving the money in there.

When you take the money out of your business, you got to pay a lot more tax and then I went and spent the money. Now, I went to bought something and now the money is gone and now I have this car. Now that I have this car, I had to insure it that cost even more money. I had to fuel it with gas that cost even more money. This car broke down all the time; that cost even more money. Then I had to think about this damn car so I had to think about it like where is it, does it need to get serviced, does it need this, does it need cleaning, does it need all of this? All of that is time; that is taking time out of my brain, that’s even more money. Then this thing is depreciating so each time, every day I own it, it gets worthless. There’s even more money.

By the time I really looked at how much money I was losing, pretty much just I thought I understood how stupid it was and then I looked that if I had invested my money into marketing campaigns and things, I would be able to buy a hundred of them and so that’s what I did and now I could but I still don’t want because I want to keep cycling through. Even when I can buy a thousand of them, I won’t buy one because it’s just pointless.

One book that is well worth a read is Accounting Made Simple. It’s 100 pages this book, so it’s very easy and it’s written in plain English and it won’t freak anyone out even if you have the biggest phobia of accounting, in numbers, in money, this book will be pleasant for you to read. You can go to consulting.com/accounting-book. The link is on the screen. Here it is. This is what it looks like; buy it. Read it. It will help you. It makes accounting so simple and it will help you get your head around this thing, how it works, why we have to do all of that. Once you can get your head around the basics of accounting and once you can get your head around these financial tracking sheets, then you’re going to have a competitive advantage over your other people in your market that is just unheard of, like being a [gun 01:07:10] at finance puts you at the front.

One thing that made me dangerous if I had to think about it was that I know how to market and I know how to sell and I know how to advertise and I know how to do all the finance stuff. I know how to do all of it and really well. That means that I can compete with other people in areas where they don’t even see. I’m competing in areas that other people can’t even see it and that’s when you get good. You’re hitting people in places they don’t even know and that&#039;s how you win. That’s the ultimate game of chess, a game where someone doesn’t even know how you win it. Buy that book; read it.

When it comes time to file your taxes and produce financial statements which it’s going to come for everyone in this program, and I know a lot of entrepreneurs and consultants get all stressed out the first time they have to file because they have no idea what to do and they try and do it all themselves and it’s near impossible. You don’t want to do this. You want to use an accountant, a CPA, and there’s many reasons why.

Number one is they’re going to know what they’re doing hopefully. Most of the time, they should. If they know what they’re doing, then chances are that you’re not going to make any really bad mistakes. Another thing is that you’re way less likely to get in trouble if you use one. They have some liability when they audit … They don’t audit it but when they produce all of your financials and file your taxes and everything. They’re not going to file things which they think are wrong and this helps you again. Then also, you’re less likely to get audited when a CPA has done it all correctly. You shouldn’t … If you’re really worried about that anyway because you should be keeping your books perfect but it’s just a headache either way. You want to use an accountant that’s worth the additional money and it’s hardly that much money anyway especially if you use the financial tracking sheet and everything I’ve given you and use like QuickBooks and if you use Shoeboxed.

When it comes to the end of the year, when you need to file your taxes, get an accountant and get them to help you. If want to know how find one or you should search online for somebody local or ask a friend for a referral. When your local town, you can probably just Google it or you could go to QuickBooks and you could look for some of their qualified people that do accounting in your particular area. Or you could ask a friend that you know who has a business, you can ask in the Facebook group, you can do all sorts of things. You&#039;ll easily be able to find a good accountant to help you out. I highly recommend on when you’re filing those taxes. It will take a lot of stress off you and it will make sure that it’s done the right way. We always want to make sure that we dot our I’s and cross our T’s because that way we never have anything to worry about.

The way I run my business I always say to my accountants and everything I assume we’re always getting audited, assume we get audited every week. That way, if we ever do, I’ve got nothing to worry about. That’s way I run my business. I always assume the worst. Always assume that you’re going to get audited, always assume that your financials might get pulled up on the front page of the Wall Street Journal. Because when you start thinking like that, you make sure that everything is clean and tidy and there’s nothing sketchy on there, because in my experience in watching other people, when people don’t prepare for the worst, they always end up facing it. When people prepare for it, they never end up facing it anyway. That’s how it works. Bad things come to people who don’t prepare. You want to make sure that you’re doing everything correctly and that will enable you to sleep well at night. You’re not going to be stressed and you’ve never got anything to worry about. This will take a lot of pressure and a lot of stress off you as a business owner and entrepreneur and a consultant. Those are some final notes on accounting and finance.

That&#039;s it for this training module. Thanks for watching and I’ll see you in the next one right now.
