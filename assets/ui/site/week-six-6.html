                        Hey, everyone. It&#039;s Sam Ovens here, and welcome to this training module called Platform Growth and Scale. In this module I&#039;m going to show you how to really build your platform. If you&#039;re wondering what your platform is, well, your platform it like your network of connections. It&#039;s your list of people that follow you. It might be your email list, your Facebook friends list. Might be your clients list. It&#039;s basically the platform of people that you have connections with.


Your platform really is one of your most important assets in your entire consulting business, and most people neglect it. In this training module I&#039;m going to really show you how to grow your platform and how to build a relationship with it, and also how to really scale your business up at the same time. Let&#039;s jump right into it.


Here&#039;s what we&#039;re going to cover in today&#039;s training. First up, we&#039;re going to discuss why your platform is your single greatest asset in your consulting business. Then we&#039;re going to discuss how to consistently build and farm your platform at one time. With a platform it&#039;s not just about building it and it&#039;s not just about farming it. It&#039;s about both, and if you don&#039;t do both then you won&#039;t have a platform or you will quickly disintegrate the platform that you built. So, it&#039;s important to cover both of these. I&#039;m going to show you methods and strategies and tactics of exactly how to do that. Then we&#039;re going to discuss three killer referral strategies. We&#039;re actually going to discuss four. I added another one in there. We&#039;re going to discuss four referral strategies that are really going to enable you to get referrals from your clients. You know referrals is a huge growth engine for consultants if they know how to use it. In this training module I&#039;m going to show you how to do that, and I&#039;m going to give you four proven methods to do it.


Then we&#039;re going to bring all of our strategies together into one cohesive plan. So, we&#039;ve covered a lot of ground in this training up until this point. We&#039;ve covered a lot of strategies, a lot of tactics, and a lot different things to help you build your business, but what we&#039;re really going to do towards the end of this training module is just bring it all together. We&#039;re going to tie it all up, wrap it up together. Then what we&#039;re going to do is we&#039;re going to plan out your promotions. I&#039;m going to tell you why it&#039;s vital to plan promotions as a consultant, and we&#039;re going to plan out the next 30 days, the next 60 days, and the next 90 days for you. We&#039;re going to map out these plans so that you know exactly what you&#039;re going to do. That&#039;s what we&#039;re going to cover.


At this stage of the program, you know how to craft your consulting offer. You know how to sell it, market it, and you even know how to manage your consulting business. And not just at a beginners level, but at a level that&#039;s far superior to 99% of the market out there. Now that we&#039;ve got those major things covered, it&#039;s time to start building your platform. Your platform is your single greatest asset as a consultant. It gives you the ability to influence people and get clients whenever you want. This training module is going to show you exactly how to do that. So, let&#039;s get to work.


Up first, why your platform is your single greatest asset. First of all, what is a platform? You might be wondering what is this platform thing? Is it something we stand on? What is it? Well, a platform is a collection of people that you have connections with and the ability to distribute information to. For example, Facebook friends, could be Facebook fans on your fan page, email subscribers, clients, Facebook group members, et cetera. A platform provides you with an opportunity to voice your views or initiate action. It&#039;s a powerful tool for rallying your market, attracting clients, and scaling your consulting business.


In this diagram here, we&#039;ve got you here and then here&#039;s your network of people you&#039;re all connected with. Now not all connections are equal. Obviously, a client that is satisfied is worth thousands or tens of thousands of just fans on Facebook. Right? So, not all connections are equal. You know the people who have millions of connections and they look famous, they don&#039;t have as much influence as the people that just have like 100 or 1,000 happy customers because customers are worth way more in a network than just fans. Don&#039;t just think about it in terms of numbers because it doesn&#039;t work that way. Not all network connections are equal.


But when you build up your network, you have the ability to influence people. You know you can put out a message, you can relay it through the network, and you can rally people towards a cause or towards some sort of action. If you want to launch a new offer, boom, you can rally the people up. If you want to create a trend in your marketplace, you can rally the people up. Like you&#039;ve got them in your network and you can really help swing things your way when you build up a powerful platform. That&#039;s why it&#039;s such a great asset.


You might be thinking, &quot;Why exactly is our platform our single greatest asset?&quot; I get it. It can help us with promotions and stuff, but why is it that important? How is it worth money? Well, here&#039;s some examples. Here&#039;s Kim Kardashian. I&#039;m sure pretty much everyone knows who she is. As you can see, I took a screenshot of her Instagram and it has 101 million followers on it. Her followers, on Instagram alone, is 101 million. Now I&#039;m sure she has more fans than that because that&#039;s which Instagram and a lot of people know who she is, including me, and don&#039;t ... I don&#039;t have Instagram, so I&#039;m sure she&#039;s got even more. That&#039;s a big network.


Her price per endorsement, if she&#039;s going to endorse something on Instagram, just on Instagram, is a million bucks or more. When she gets into more endorsement deals that are like more intense than just an Instagram post, I mean she&#039;s going to get a lot more. Her net worth is 115 million dollars. So, Kim Kardashian, she ... Her network makes her very valuable and her platform, so she&#039;s got a very big platform. Anything she wants to voice her opinion about, she can message her people, and her people will rely that information and they will move and take action based on what she says.


Now here&#039;s a slightly bigger platform, Facebook. Active monthly users, two billion. I&#039;m not even joking. Active monthly users of Facebook, two billion people. It&#039;s mind blowing. Now their average price per click is 27 cents. You know in America we pay a lot more than that, but this is every industry all around the world. A average price per click&#039;s 27 cents. You imagine if you had two billion people online each month and if they clicked on any ad, you made 27 cents. A lot of people click on a lot of ads. That&#039;s a lot of money. And so, the evaluation 480 billion dollars. Pretty big. The founder&#039;s net worth, Mark Zuckerberg, 68 billion dollars. I&#039;m pretty sure you can see the connection here.


Your network and your connection to the network and how much influence it has, that creates value. I&#039;m sure you get the point. Having connection to people as well as the ability to influence people is worth serious money. This is why your platform is your single greatest asset. Here&#039;s some of benefits of having a strong platform.


When you have a strong platform you never have to worry about getting clients because all you need to do is send out an email broadcast or do a Facebook post or call previous clients with an idea for a new engagement. When you&#039;re starting out, it seems like you&#039;re always in survival mode. Like getting a client is such a job, you&#039;ve got to really try hard. But once you build up a platform, it just gets too easy. You know if I want to make 100,000 bucks in a day, I can send an email to my list. There&#039;s almost a million people on it. Send an email, make 100 grand. Done.


Now it doesn&#039;t mean I&#039;m going to do it every single day because a lot of time I&#039;m working on building a great product. I&#039;m not just out to just try and milk my list for all it&#039;s worth, but I could do that anytime I wanted to. Or I could just call up one of my previous clients and be like, &quot;Hey, I&#039;ve got a good idea for you that I think&#039;s going to help your business. Here&#039;s what I&#039;m thinking for a consulting fee. Do you want to sign up?&quot;


I know they&#039;re going to say yes because I&#039;ve delivered such awesome results to my clients for so many years now that they&#039;re just going to trust me. They&#039;re not even really going to listen to the idea. They&#039;re just going to think, &quot;If Sam brings it to me, then I&#039;m just going to buy it anyway,&quot; because of the relationship I&#039;ve built with them. They know I don&#039;t sell things just to make money. They know I sell things only when it adds tremendous value. That&#039;s the power of a network. I don&#039;t need to rely on all of these other things like Facebook ads and all of that. I can just pull money out whenever I want because I&#039;ve built the platform.


You can also share your views on different topics within your niche and rally people to create new trends, ideas, and philosophies. This positions you as a market leader and influencer. If you see that your industry&#039;s getting distorted on something, and you have a big network, well you can start rallying up the people and making sure things fall back into place. That&#039;s the sort of power you have when you have a network and a massive platform and a strong one. It&#039;s not just about the size of it, it&#039;s about the connections and the strength of the connections as well.


You can generate referrals from clients and attract new customers without having to use cold methods. A network&#039;s not just about ... A platform isn&#039;t just about people who are following you or who are on your email list. It&#039;s also about your clients. You know your previous clients, that&#039;s a network. Your current clients, that&#039;s a network. That&#039;s all part of your platform. You can reach out to them and generate referrals without having to touch cold advertising. You can advertise to people without having to obey the rules of other people&#039;s platforms like Facebook.


Facebook, when we&#039;re using that, that&#039;s Mark Zuckerberg&#039;s platform. That&#039;s not ours. So, when we go and play on his platform, we have to play by his rules. We have to make sure we use the right images. We have to make sure everything looks how he wants it to. Otherwise, we&#039;re not allowed to use it. When we have our own platform, we can do whatever we want. When you have your own email list, you can do whatever you want, say whatever you want, send out whatever you want because it&#039;s your platform. It&#039;s not his. It says here, &quot;You can say whatever you want, make it look however you want, and you can create your own rules.&quot;


You can advertise to people for free without having to pay another platform per impression or click. When you send out an email broadcast to your list, it&#039;s free. When you post on Facebook or whatever, it&#039;s free. But when we use paid ads and other methods, we have to pay to use the network. This is why having a strong platform brings a lot of benefits.


Now, we&#039;re going to discuss how to consistently build and farm your platform at one time. When it comes to building a platform, most people make some truly fatal mistakes. Here&#039;s the three most common mistakes. Number one. The most common mistake people make is not understanding the true value of a platform. They&#039;re never aware of it and they never care to build one. This is the category that most consultants fall into. Most consultants, they don&#039;t even have this in their awareness. It&#039;s not even in their sphere of awareness. They don&#039;t even see it. They don&#039;t even imagine or think about it. Doesn&#039;t exist. This is the most common one.


Number two. The second most common mistake people make is not building a platform, even though they&#039;re aware of it. Some people are aware that a platform could bring value, but they don&#039;t build it. They constantly go to the market cold through other people&#039;s media and they&#039;re at the mercy and control of others. So, some people are aware that you can have one, but they never do anything about it and they just keep going back to Facebook ads, and they keep going back to cold method. Whenever you do that, you&#039;re always at the mercy of their rules and things happening that are out of your control. When you build your own network and your own platform, you can rely on that, which is a lot more reliable.


The third most common mistake people make is building a platform but never caring to build a strong relationship with the members within that platform. Their platforms die and their building efforts go to waste. A lot of people think it&#039;s just like a numbers game and just building it up, but it&#039;s not about the numbers. It&#039;s mostly about the connection, the strength of the connections. It&#039;s not just about the size. Some people go out and try and build a big, big platform and then it doesn&#039;t even work for them because it&#039;s got weak connections in it. These are the three mistakes that people make with their platform.


When it comes to building a platform, it&#039;s vital to build it and farm it at the same time. Here&#039;s how we build our platform. We&#039;ve got three images here. On the left, we&#039;ve got your market. This could be your niche or your overall market. Let&#039;s say if I&#039;m helping plumbers, well this is plumbers. The connections between them all, you know, these are all the different plumbers and how they&#039;re connected to each other and the different trade associations and all of the things that tie that cluster together.


Then we have other people&#039;s platforms in the middle. This could be something like Facebook or Google AdWords. These are the plumbers from the market who were on someone else&#039;s network and platform like Facebook, Google, et cetera.


Then on the far right, we have our platform. This is our connections of friends on Facebook, on our email list subscribers, on our customer list, and on everything we have, Facebook followers, et cetera. This is our platform. What we&#039;re trying to do is we&#039;re trying to ... We need to get into this market here. We need to get into this platform. We need some way to bridge from ours to this because we need to hook in somehow. The way we do that is we use a platform where we can pay. That&#039;s something like Google AdWords or Facebook. So, Facebook has all of these connections, or not all of them but most of them. Same with Google.


What we do is we come onto here and these people are in here. Then we pay Facebook or Google and we get access to these people. Every time we get access to these people we&#039;re bringing them across. It&#039;s like we&#039;re linking the from here to here to here. We&#039;re just pulling them over into our platform. What we&#039;re really doing is just siphoning off this platform. We&#039;re just sucking it and sucking it and pulling it over. I mean we&#039;re not really making much of a dent in Facebook at all because it&#039;s got two billion monthly active users, and we&#039;re just pulling over a few people. But over time, we&#039;re starting to build up our platform.


What we want to do at the same time as we&#039;re feeding off of this network, we want to be building and strengthening the relationship of this platform here. Then when we do that, this thing here is going to get bigger and bigger and bigger over time. It&#039;s going to become a seriously powerful asset when you start to build it up bigger. Like I said, my lists almost a million people. You can do a lot of damage when you have a million people on an email list.


Methods to build your platform. Everyday we&#039;re building our platform through direct connections to the market and through other people&#039;s platforms. Every person you connect with and the impression left on them contributes to your platform. People opt into your fragmentation funnel to watch the value video. Well, whenever someone does this, you&#039;re building your email list because you&#039;re getting their email address. This is building a platform. Then people schedule appointments with us and they complete surveys. Well, this is building our pipeline and our Facebook friends list. We&#039;re getting a pipeline of people that we&#039;re going to talk to on the phone, and every time we talk to someone on the phone we&#039;re going to build a relationship with them. Whether they buy or not, they&#039;re still going to remember that. They&#039;re still going to have an impression made on them.


Then we&#039;re also going to be adding everyone on Facebook as a friend when they apply for a strategy session. Now we&#039;re growing that network as well. You see, these things seem very small and very like ... What&#039;s the word? They seem like they&#039;re not really adding much. They&#039;re very ... I forgot what the word is, but they&#039;re not really contributing much. Individually they don&#039;t look like they&#039;re doing much at all. However, over time you&#039;ll be amazed to see how this stuff piles up and it becomes a really powerful asset after a while.


Then people click on your ads, and then your target pixel nests in their browser. So, whenever someone clicks on your ad, we pixel them and then we&#039;re building up our retargeting list. We&#039;ve got our email list. We&#039;ve got our list of people that we&#039;re going to talk to on phone. We&#039;ve got our Facebook friends list growing. And we&#039;ve got our pixel, retargeting list growing. Then we do strategy sessions with people and they sign up and become clients or not. This builds our customer list. Your customers are the most powerful connections in your network. They&#039;re worth thousands of normal individual connections. Because they&#039;ve spent money with you, they have a way deeper connection with you. Those people in a network, customers, the ones that you really want to focus on the most.


We complete work for our clients, get them results, and satisfy them. This builds our referral list. Whenever we have satisfied clients, they&#039;re going to refer us to other people. And so, we&#039;re growing all of these different lists. The email list, Facebook friends list, retargeting list, our customer list, and our satisfied customer list, which is going to be our referral list, which is going to bring more customers. All of this builds your platform over time, and eventually it starts to compound and snowball. That&#039;s how you build your platform. That&#039;s what we&#039;re doing every single day if you follow all of the instructions as I&#039;ve outlined them in this program.


Now here&#039;s how you farm your platform. On the one hand we&#039;re building, on the other hand we&#039;re farming it. Methods to farm your platform. Building a platform is only half the work. The other half is farming it. So, everyday you must build your platform and farm it at the same time. This is done by communicating with members on the platform and adding value. Here&#039;s some things you want to do. One is you could post every day on your Facebook personal file and on your fan page with organic posts. These could just be updates. Hey, here&#039;s what&#039;s going on. Here&#039;s a new client. Here&#039;s a testimonial. Here&#039;s something I&#039;m working on. You&#039;re not even trying to sell. You&#039;re just updating people. When you do this, you&#039;re building the engagement. You&#039;re staying in front of them and you&#039;re building a deeper connection with them.


You also want to send one email to your list every week with updates, tip, stories, et cetera. This builds relationship as well. When you have an email list, you want to start by at least emailing it once a month. Then when you start to get a bit bigger, start emailing it once every two weeks, and then once every week. Just send them random things like ... They&#039;re not really random, but send them updates about your business, tips, stories, case studies, all of this sort of stuff. Then you want to invite your list to a live webinar with you once per month and make an offer. This really builds the relationship with everybody and it gets clients as well. Once a month you could send an email, broadcast out, and we covered this is week four, our organic methods. We showed how to do list farming in a list farming webinar. If you aren&#039;t familiar with that, refer back to week four, organic methods.


I really show you that you can send out an email to your list, get them to opt in for a webinar. You can hold a webinar with them, and then people will sign up for strategy sessions. This is another way to build a relationship because people get to hear you live. They get to ask you questions live. They get to understand more about you live. Then we&#039;re going to get more strategy sessions from it. We&#039;re going to get clients from it too. Then you want to share case studies and success stories with your email list once a month. This really builds a relationship. If you have clients that have awesome results, which you should. That&#039;s what we&#039;re doing. Well, you want to get a testimonial from them. Then type up a case study. Then publish it on your website. Publish it on your Facebook page. Send an email out to your list and be like, &quot;Hey, look. Here&#039;s what so-and-of achieved.&quot; Communicate it. Share with your platform what&#039;s going on.


Then you want to ask your satisfied clients for referrals and testimonials once you&#039;ve helped them. This is really building the relationship and referrals. It&#039;s building a deeper relationship with your satisfied clients and we&#039;re getting a list of referrals who are going to become clients as well. All of these activities, they all deepen the relationship and they really strengthen the platform and the connections between all of the different things in the platform.


Most importantly, just stay in front of your platform and provide value on a regular basis so that they know you&#039;re still around continuing to grow and improve. This stirs the pot and people take notice over time. A lot of people think that it&#039;s just if someone doesn&#039;t buy immediately then it&#039;s done. That&#039;s not true. You know a lot of the time people come back around and buy. I can&#039;t tell you how many people haven&#039;t bought from me after like sitting on sidelines and watched for like years. Different people come in at different stages. They&#039;re like, &quot;I just can&#039;t handle this anymore. I should&#039;ve jumped in five years ago, but I didn&#039;t, so I&#039;m just going to do it now.&quot; Even your doubters, even people that don&#039;t like you, they come around over time. This is why you want to just keep stirring that pot. Keep stirring the pot. Even the people who don&#039;t like you, they&#039;re going to come and like you. Just keep stirring.


If you build and farm your platform everyday it will become your single greatest asset over time. You want to learn to play the long game. You don&#039;t want to look like every other fly-by-night huckster on the internet. This may be a sobering moment for many of you watching this video right now. Here&#039;s what most people look like when they&#039;re coming into consulting and when they&#039;re marketing and doing things like that. Here&#039;s the big mistake most people make.


Most so called experts enter a new niche, and they try to make some money with ads and funnels that reveal that they don&#039;t really know the niche at all. So when someone first enters a niche and they create a funnel, it&#039;s often not the best because it&#039;s their first attempt at it and they&#039;re brand new. It really reveals to the insiders of the niche, &quot;Oh, hey look. Look at this new person. Wonder how long they&#039;ll last.&quot; People are watching, but they&#039;re not really taking action. They&#039;re just like, &quot;Let&#039;s see if this guy&#039;s for real or not. Let&#039;s see if he&#039;s going to stick around or if he&#039;s just going to be like those other people we saw that just says, &#039;Hey, come here. Attend this video.&#039; We&#039;ll see if he lasts for more than a week.&quot;


One to two months go by and then the person doesn&#039;t land any clients. So they think to themselves, &quot;Well, it wasn&#039;t me. This niche doesn&#039;t bite. You know, this entire niche, these accountants, these lawyers, this entire group of people, they don&#039;t buy anything.&quot; I hear people say this all the time. &quot;Nah, that niche doesn&#039;t buy.&quot; You&#039;re like an niche, an entire population doesn&#039;t buy. Man, the idiocy of some people. It&#039;s not their fault. It&#039;s the niche. They don&#039;t buy anything. It&#039;s mad. Or this niche is broke. &quot;Yeah, man. I tried selling to that niche and they&#039;re all broke. You know all six million of them. They&#039;re all broke. No money. It&#039;s not my fault it&#039;s just the niche. They&#039;re broke.&quot; Things didn&#039;t go as well as they had planned so they bail out of the niche and then repeat the process in another other. The same thing happens again and they just keep repeating the process. They&#039;re just keeping on, cycling through wondering, thinking, &quot;Shit, is everyone in the world broke? Does everyone in the world not buy?&quot; Yeah, it&#039;s all them.


The market is watching you. You earn their respect by understanding their craft and adding value over time. By all means, iterate if things are not working for you and if you&#039;ve given it your absolute best try. You know you don&#039;t stick to it forever if you&#039;ve been trying and giving it your all and it&#039;s just somehow not working. I mean sometimes your observations about these things can be accurate. If that is the case, iterate, try a different niche. But understand that the big rewards in bus, the big money, and the big respect, none of that comes until you have committed yourself for a long amount of time. Most people just don&#039;t get this. It&#039;s called the snowball effect.


This is what it looks like. You start off small and you just keep going. You gain a bit more respect from the niche. You learn a bit more about them. More people come to favor you. They&#039;re like, &quot;Oh, yeah. Well this guy&#039;s stuck around. He&#039;s made an effort. He&#039;s learned about it. Yeah, let&#039;s give him a go.&quot; They sign up and this snowball keep gaining momentum and it keeps gaining momentum, and then before you know it, this thing&#039;s turned into a full blown fucking avalanche and you can&#039;t even stop it. That&#039;s what happens. There&#039;s the snowball effect. But most people bail out when they&#039;re still just a small little snow crystal. They&#039;re like, &quot;Nah, this niche doesn&#039;t buy.&quot; They just don&#039;t give it enough effort and enough time.


Now, let&#039;s discuss four killer referral strategies. Now that you understand the value that a platform provides as well as how to build and farm a platform of your own, let&#039;s talk about some proven referral strategies that you can use to exponentially grow your business. When executed correctly, these referral strategies can 2x, 4x, even 10x your consulting business without having to bring on additional cold clients.


The problem most consultants make is that they never ask for referrals, and if they don&#039;t use ... if they do they don&#039;t use proven referral strategies. Here&#039;s why most consultants fail to get referrals. First and foremost, most consultants over promise when they sign up new clients. You know they promise the world and the moon and everything else. Then what happens is, of course, they under deliver that it comes to delivering the actual services, results, and value. It&#039;s not that they didn&#039;t try. It&#039;s that they just promised way too much that it&#039;s impossible to deliver what they promised. So even when you do a stunning job, if you over promised their client&#039;s still not going to be happy because they didn&#039;t get what they were told they were going to get. If this happens, nobody is ever going to refer you to anyone. In fact, they&#039;re going to go out of their way to tell people not to buy from you. This is what most people don&#039;t get.


First of all, before you use any slick strategies, you&#039;ve got to actually help your clients. That&#039;s the most important thing. If you help your clients, then you pretty much don&#039;t even need to know any slick strategies. They&#039;ll just do it. That&#039;s the best referral strategy in the world is to really help your clients.


The second point, most consultants don&#039;t ask for referrals until after the work is done, and by this stage the client is unlikely to give you a referral because they&#039;ve forgotten about how bad things were before and they&#039;ve climatized to the new level. This happens all the time. You start helping a client and their situation&#039;s bad. Then a month or two or three go by. Then the client&#039;s having major success, but if you ask them for a referral after the work&#039;s done, they&#039;ve kind of forgotten about how bad things were and this is just their new normal. So they don&#039;t really think that you&#039;ve done that much. It&#039;s not really their fault. I mean people forget about these things. It&#039;s just that you should&#039;ve asked before you started working with them, not afterwards.


Most consultants ask for referrals at random without the use of a proven referral strategy. This shotgun approach rarely works because it&#039;s too inconsistent and it leaves too much thinking on the client&#039;s end. When you come to asking for a referral, you want to do it the right way. You want to remove a lot of the thinking from the client because if they client has to think too much, then they&#039;re just going to be like, &quot;Oh, that&#039;s too much work. Forget it. I&#039;m not doing one.&quot; You want to take all of the decision fatigue and all the process fatigue out of the equation for them. You want to make it simple, and you want to follow a proven, repeatable strategy. This is why most consultants fail to get referrals.


If you&#039;re making any of these mistakes in your consulting business, then you need to fix it immediately. These four referral strategies, which I&#039;m about to show you, will show you how to do it. Referral strategy number one: The moonshot service delivery method. The best referral strategy in the world is to deliver moonshot service delivery to your clients. This is when you under promise and over deliver in every way. So you provide profound results to people even though you didn&#039;t have to and even though they weren&#039;t expecting it. No strategy on earth can trump this. This is hands down the best referral strategy in the world and it&#039;s not even a referral strategy. This is how it works. Most people are unaware of this stuff. They think it&#039;s all about the slick lines, the chat bots, the videos, the slick websites and stuff when it&#039;s not. It&#039;s mostly about just doing what you say you were going to do and really helping your client. If you do that, you don&#039;t need any of the slick stuff.


You don&#039;t want to over promise. You want to under promise. Because when you over promise, people don&#039;t really believe you anyway and then you always under deliver and then people don&#039;t like you. But when you under promise, people think you&#039;re honest. Then when you over deliver, they think that you&#039;re amazing. That&#039;s the right way to do it. And in a world full of marketing, tech, and tactics, most people lose sight of what&#039;s most important and it&#039;s the work. What are we actually doing for our client and what results are they getting? It&#039;s not about all of the other stuff. It&#039;s about the work, the results, the effort.


The best marketer in the world with the best technology in the world will lose to an honest professional who knows nothing about marketing or technology but just delivers outstanding work to his clients. In a world full of social media and people with big mouths, eventually, it doesn&#039;t matter what you say. It only matters what you do. Slick marketing, it may give somebody a short-term lead, but in time the work always wins. Sometimes you see people have a meteoric rise with slick marketing. That&#039;s all fine, but it never lasts. It&#039;s aways short lived. In time, the quality work always wins. There&#039;s just no ifs or buts, it&#039;s always going to win. It&#039;s just a matter of time. As Michael Jordan said, &quot;Let your game speak.&quot; Don&#039;t build your game on flash, build it on fire. The best referral strategy in the world isn&#039;t a referral strategy at all. It&#039;s just to deliver outstanding work and to really let your work speak. Because if you do that, then people will go and shout your name from the roof tops to everyone they know. That&#039;s the best referral strategy in the world.


First and foremost you have to do this. If you don&#039;t do this, then none of the other referral strategies are going work. This here must be done first. This is the foundations. If the foundations aren&##039;t set, then the things that we&#039;re going to erect on top of the foundations aren&#039;t going to work. This is the bedrock of it. The following three strategies are things which you can build on top of this, but please understand that this has to happen first.


Here&#039;s a pin-up which I&#039;ve included in the Resources section beneath this video for download. It&#039;s about this main point, which I just made. It says, &quot;those who know don&#039;t talk and those who talk don&#039;t know.&quot; In business and in life, don&#039;t listen to what people say. Look at what they do. In the modern world with technology and social media, there&#039;s a lot of people who speak a big game, but there&#039;s no substance at the base of it. Their game is built on flash not fire.


As Michael Jordan said, &quot;Let your game speak.&quot; A lot of people back when he was playing NBA, a lot of people would always speak like, &quot;Yeah, I&#039;m going to win. I&#039;m the best,&quot; or all this stuff. Michael Jordan just said, &quot;Well, let your game speak.&quot; Why are you talking? Why don&#039;t you just play? There&#039;s no need to talk about it. Just do it. Don&#039;t tell people how great you are or how you&#039;re going to achieve this or that. Let your results speak for you. You want to under promise and over deliver. That&#039;s the best marketing strategy in the entire world to not market at all.


That&#039;s why those who know don&#039;t talk and those who talk don&#039;t know. The people with the biggest mouths often have pretty much nothing. The people who are quiet often have the most skills and pretty much everything. And so you want to become aware of this distinction. Also, when you&#039;re trying to get referrals and when you&#039;re trying to grow your business, understand that the most important things are the things that you don&#039;t say. The most important things are the things that you do. Don&#039;t think that it&#039;s all about how you promote yourself and how loud you are on social media and stuff. It&#039;s more about the work that you deliver. If you deliver amazing results to your clients, then you pretty much don&#039;t even need to speak because they&#039;re going to speak for you. That&#039;s the most powerful business strategy in the world, to not market at all.


Now referral strategy number two: The ballsy condition of doing business. I like said, all of these referral strategies following that first one only work if the first one is done. If you just got a slick tactic for asking someone for a referral, they&#039;re not going to do it if the work wasn&#039;t impressive. Strategy number two: The ballsy condition of doing business. This is my favorite method to use, however, it only works for you once you&#039;re confident in your ability to deliver results and whoa the client. Don&#039;t use this if you&#039;re just getting started and you&#039;re unsure of yourself. This is for somebody who has got confidence in what they do and they know that they&#039;re good at it.


When somebody is ready to buy from you state the following ... So this is after someone said, &quot;Yep. Let&#039;s do it,&quot; and they&#039;ve signed up and everything. You want to share this before you start the work. &quot;So, as you know the life blood of my business is referrals and I pride myself on delivering great service. When my clients refer me to other people, it&#039;s like a special way of saying, &#039;Thanks for going above and beyond.&#039; A condition of doing business with me is that you must provide me with three referrals as soon as you&#039;re satisfied with the work that I complete. Is this going to be an issue for you?&quot; When you ask this up front before starting to work with your clients, they remember agreeing to this. Then when the time comes for getting testimonials the stage is already set and foreshadowed from this.


This is why we ask before. Because when they agree to this, then they forget about it a lot of the time, but then when we ask them their brain pings back to this time when they agreed. It&#039;s already foreshadowed the event. So when we go to ask, we&#039;ve already lined their brain up to go, &quot;Sure.&quot; That&#039;s how it works. That&#039;s why we ask early and then we recall that response in the future. That&#039;s how it works. If you&#039;ve got the thought seeded before the event, then when you go to ask after the event you already know what the answer is. That&#039;s how this one works.


Referral strategy number three: The discount in exchange for a referral. This method works well for people who think the price is high and are interested in getting a discount. They are essentially able to get their entire bill reduced to zero just by telling their friends. This makes it free to them if they refer enough people. When somebody is ready to buy from you, after they have signed up and everything, had the strategy session but before you&#039;ve started the work state the following, &quot;As you know, the life blood of my business is referrals and I pride myself on delivering great service. When my clients refer me to other people, it&#039;s like a special way of saying, &#039;Thanks for going above and beyond.&#039; The current price I&#039;ve quoted you is $10,000,&quot; for example. &quot;However, I like to incentivize my clients when they send business my way. If you&#039;re able to connect me with three people in the next month, and they end up signing up becoming clients, I&#039;m happy to knock $5,000 off you bill. How does that sound?&quot;


Just like the previous method, we ask this up front before any of the work begins. This way the client has plenty of time to think about who they can refer while we&#039;re completing the work, and as soon as we ask for referrals at the end the client already knows who to refer and sometimes has already referred them. That&#039;s how this one works. So when someone&#039;s really humming and haring about the bill price, well this referral strategy can really work because they&#039;re like, &quot;Oh, okay. Well, I can easily get it down half price or I can get it down totally free. I&#039;ve just got to ... Who can I refer?&quot; Their brain starts ticking. They&#039;re thinking, &quot;Who can I refer?&quot;


Referral strategy number four: The way for you to make more money. This method works well for people who have large followings and networks. By giving them the way to not only get your services for free, but make money at the same time, you&#039;re able to generate exponential growth. If you work with someone who has a lot of influence and a large network, then this can be a very good strategy. Where somebody is ready to buy from you, state the following, &quot;As you know, the life blood of my business is referrals and I pride myself on delivering great service. When my clients refer me to other people it&#039;s like a special way of saying, &#039;Thanks for going above and beyond.&#039; I like to incentivize my clients to refer business my way, and I have a special program set up where I pay you $1,000 per successful referral. You can refer as many people as you want and I&#039;ll pay you $1,000 cash for each one. Are there any names that come to mind for you right now?&quot;


Like all of our referral strategies, we ask this up front before the work begins. This gives the client to think over the opportunity and watch us perform our work while thinking to themselves, &quot;Should I refer this person to the rest of my network? Are they good enough for me to endorse them?&quot; So we want to ask this before to get their brain ticking. Now when we&#039;re doing the work for them, they&#039;re observing us. They&#039;re thinking, &quot;Is this guy really good? Should I tell everyone I know about this guy?&quot; But if we don&#039;t ask, then they&#039;re never thinking that. Then when we do ask then they&#039;re like, &quot;Oh, I haven&#039;t observed him. I&#039;m not really confident endorsing him.&quot; That&#039;s why you ask up front and then start the work because now they&#039;re already observing you with that in mind. So when the work&#039;s done and you go to ask, you&#039;ve already foreshadowed the event. You&#039;ve already created the answer.


Now let&#039;s discuss bringing all of our strategies together into one cohesive plan. By this stage of the training program we&#039;ve covered a lot of ground and learned a ton of strategies. Here&#039;s a summary of all the different promotional strategies that we&#039;ve covered. We taught you the Facebook posts method. This is organic posts on your Facebook fan page or your personal profile. Then the direct outreach method. This is when we private message someone on Facebook, LinkedIn, or we just email them. Then the lump mail method. This is when we send a lumpy mail package to them. Physical mail. Then the list farming method. This is when we send an email to our list and invite them to a live webinar. Then the JV webinar method. This is when we partner with someone in our network who has access to our network and we hold a webinar with them. They email their list and then we deliver the webinar to their list and they get a cut.


Then the paid attraction method. This is when use our fragmentation funnel and paid Facebook ads to drive it. Then platform building. How we really build up a platform, which is what we&#039;ve been talking about in this module here. How we build up that platform and we do that through all of the different activities that we&#039;re doing. Then we&#039;ve got platform farming, which is really strengthening the bonds and the ties and the links within that network and within that platform. Then we&#039;ve got our four referral strategies. First of all, the real bedrock of it all, which is delivering stunning service. Then on top of that we&#039;ve got some good methods and strategies for asking people. These are all the things we&#039;ve covered. There&#039;s a total of nine things here. There&#039;s a lot of stuff here and a lot of powerful stuff at that.


Now let&#039;s talk about how to pull all of these together into one cohesive implementation plan. This is planning promotions and your 30/60/90 day plans. The best way to integrate all of our strategies is to plan our promotions ahead of time. You don&#039;t just wake up each day and be like, &quot;Oh, shit. What do I do?&quot; We plan ahead of time. That way when we wake up on the day all we do is do it. The best way to plan promotions ahead of time is to plot them on your war map calendar. If you&#039;re thinking, &quot;What&#039;s a war map calendar?&quot; This is a war map calendar.


This war map calendar allows you to plan your entire year from a bird&#039;s eye 30,000 foot view all the way down to the daily action items every single day. This is available for download in the Resources section. You can open it with Microsoft Excel. Click the blue link in the top right and open it in Google drive. We&#039;re going to take a look at it right now. In Google Drive it looks like this. You can see on the front tab here it says Dashboard. This is a high-level view of our whole year. Then we can drill down into each month like January, February, March, April, all the way to the end of the year. All right?


We covered this back in week four in planning your 30 day attack, which was in week four&#039;s training. If you haven&#039;t done that, go back and do that now because otherwise you won&#039;t be too familiar with this.


Like I said, we covered this in detail in week four&#039;s module: Planning your 30 day attack. So, what&#039;s different this time? Well, nothing really. We&#039;re just planning 30, 60, 90 days out instead of the immediate 30 days in front of us. It&#039;s slightly longer term planning and it&#039;s designed to carefully integrate all of the powerful strategies we&#039;ve covered throughout the program. With that being said, here&#039;s how you plan your 30/60/90 day plan. I&#039;ve got a step-by-step process here.


Back in week four when we covered planning your 30 day attack, it was really about planning just those immediate 30 days and trying to take some really powerful action to break in some new habits and to burn some new habits into our brain. Now what we&#039;re doing is we&#039;re doing more long-term planning and we&#039;re doing more promotional planning to make sure that we&#039;re growing our platform and we&#039;re integrating a nice mix of things. Here&#039;s the process.


Number one: Start by opening the war map calendar in Google Drive and saving it as a new copy for yourself. Open this up. You can open it in Google Docs here, and you can save it as a new copy. Two: Plot all your mandatory life activities first. These are things like your job, family time, weekends, vacations, et cetera. The first thing we want to do is plot out things, the days which we absolutely have to ... You know we can&#039;t work. Let&#039;s say from here to here I&#039;m in some random country. I don&#039;t know. I&#039;m going to block this out and next to this color here I&#039;m just going to put ... Well, let&#039;s just assume that, or we use the right color actually. It&#039;s best to keep this thing in order so we use this red. Then I&#039;ll type in here Spain holiday or Spain vacation. All right?


You want to block out the times where you absolutely cannot work first. Or if you take every Sunday off to be with your children or whatever or if there&#039;s days you can&#039;t work because you&#039;re just doing huge hours at the office, block them out. The first thing we need to do is understand what days we can&#039;t work so that we can see what days are left.


Step three: Now plot essential service delivery activities. These are things like delivering the services to your clients, doing coaching calls if you&#039;ve got those, live events or masterminds that you might be hosting or you might be attending them. If you&#039;re attending a live event, you probably want to plot those days in because after a full day event you&#039;re pretty worn out. You&#039;re probably not going to do any work so block it out. Make sure that you include travel time on both sides. You know entrepreneurs are so optimistic that they think that, &quot;I&#039;ll get back and I&#039;ll just be back to work.&quot; Probably not. You&#039;re probably going to be out for like a day, so put a day either side of it. Really be honest with yourself here and block out all the time where you just know you&#039;re not going to get a full day&#039;s work.


Now four: Now plot at least one day per week which you will dedicate to improving yourself or your business. This can be things like creating workflows and systems, learning new information, or testing new things. It&#039;s very important to plot this day in otherwise it never, ever, ever gets a day. You want to plot one day each week where you&#039;re going to do this stuff. You might be thinking out in the next 30 day ... over the next 30 days or the next ... You want to think out pretty much 90 days out. If you&#039;ve got events planned a year out, plot those ones too.


It&#039;s important to have this day blocked out because this is where we create those workflows and systems that we talked about in the previous module, module number five, which was all about project management and workflows. It&#039;s also a good day for us to read some books or check out new things which we need to know in our industry. It&#039;s a good day for tinkering as well. You know sometimes the best things we learn is from tinkering when we&#039;re not even really trying to achieve anything. We&#039;re just playing around and having fun. Sometimes we need these days to improve our businesses. Otherwise, if all you ever do is sell, sell, sell, sell, sell, then your business is going to get outdate and just collapse. The chassis&#039; going to collapse. You know you need to always block out some time to work on this thing.


Now step five: The time you have left is available for promotions and selling. This can be things like Facebook posts, emails to your list, live webinars to your list, direct outreach, Facebook ads, and lumpy mail. You want to observe on here the days you&#039;ve got left. You might observe out in the next ... Let&#039;s say we&#039;re on January 1st right now. Let&#039;s just assume that. Let&#039;s say I got a vacation here and then I&#039;ve got a vacation here. I&#039;m going to plan these next 90 days out. Then let&#039;s say for on every ... On these days here, I&#039;m going to be improving my business. I&#039;m going to mark these with orange. This is down here, so every one of these days let&#039;s say I&#039;m just going to be improving the business for the next 90 days out. Now I&#039;ve blocked that. Improve ... business improvement day.


Then let&#039;s say that every one of these ... I don&#039;t know what day this is. Let&#039;s just assume this is Sunday. You&#039;re going to take the time to this properly and look in each month. Let&#039;s say these days I&#039;ve got to block out because they&#039;re family days. You go ahead and block these out. Put them here. Family day. Now these days that I have left are days which I can use to promote and grow my business. All right?


Now what I want to do each month is I can see 1st to the 10th is blocked. Then 12, 17, 22, 27, these are all blocked. Now I can come in here and I pretty much know that the 1st to the 10th is out so I can just pretty much come down here and I can just block this out. I could just put on any color. Then I only really have these days here. So, 11, 16, 21, 28, 30. Right? You can see all the days you&#039;ve got spare. Now you drill down into the specific month and on those days that you&#039;ve got available, you want to plot what you&#039;re going to do. Let&#039;s just say here I want to plan some different promotions. Things like Facebook posts, emails to your list, live webinars to your list. Let&#039;s say that once a month on the Thursday that I&#039;m going to do a live webinar to my list. Then let&#039;s say every second day I&#039;m going to do a post, so a Facebook post, Facebook post, and even on this day Facebook post. Right?


You could just go ahead and plot that through here, so you know exactly what you&#039;re going to be doing. Then, what else am I going to do? Direct outreach and Facebook ads and lumpy mail. Let&#039;s say that on every day, every single day I&#039;m going to be doing 10 times direct outreach. I&#039;m going to plot this every day. Let&#039;s just say I&#039;m doing direct outreach on all of these days and I&#039;m not doing anything on Sunday because that was the family days. Then I&#039;m on vacation up until the 10th. You get the point.


I&#039;m just doing this very quick and rough, but you start out blocking out the days that you can&#039;t work. Then you drill down into each month and you say on each day what are you going to do? You want to make sure that you&#039;ve got a good mixture of things in here. Organic posts, direct outreach, list farming. You want to do a live webinar. You want to get a good mix of stuff in here. You want to make sure that every day you&#039;re doing something to drive your business forward. Every day you want to be putting in some amount of effort. Even if it doesn&#039;t feel like it&#039;s doing anything, it&#039;s going to be building momentum.


I said in six here you want to make sure that you&#039;re covering a good mixture of these promotional methods so that you&#039;re building your platform and farming it at the same time as growing your business. By doing this it&#039;s both a short-term and a long-term play. We&#039;re trying to grow our business. We&#039;re trying to get clients and make money. That is certain, and we&#039;re doing that. But at the same time we are trying to grow a long-term asset. And so we&#039;re in two minds at the same time. We&#039;re obviously trying to get clients and make money because we need that, but we&#039;re also trying to grow that asset because in the long term it&#039;s just going to make it way easier and we&#039;re going to turn what was just a small little snowflake into an out of control unstoppable avalanche.


If you&#039;re stumped trying to figure out the right mix of all of these different promotional strategies to put into your 30 day, 60 day, and 90 day plans well here&#039;s a winning formula that you can follow. So the 30/60/90 day plan winning formula. You should run, and this is in an ideal world where you could do all of these things. If you can&#039;t do all of these things, don&#039;t worry. I mean you can only do what you can do, but don&#039;t be lazy.


You should run Facebook ads every single day. This is your work horse that&#039;s constantly working for you. If you can, run ads all the time. My ads haven&#039;t been off for years. No days. Even on Christmas I run them because I just want to keep stirring that pot. I just want to keep pounding it, keep being in front of people. You know some days it&#039;s not very profitable, even if it&#039;s a holiday. Some people would be like, &quot;Well, why would you run ads on that day?&quot; I&#039;m like, &quot;Why would I turn it off?&quot; We&#039;ve got so much momentum up I just want to keep this beast going. Who knows what impression ... Like if I land an impression on someone one day, I don&#039;t know what that person&#039;s going to do in a month, in six weeks, in a year or whatever. So I want to just keep stirring it and I&#039;m trying to advertise every day.


You want to reach out to at least five new people every day using direct outreach or lumpy mail. Every day. The key word here is every day because when you do this it builds massive momentum. Michael Phelps, who&#039;s like the best swimmer in the world, who&#039;s won multiple gold medals at the Olympics, his goal was real simple and his to-do list was real simple. It said, &quot;Wake up. Get in pool.&quot; That was it. He woke up and he got in the pool. That was it. If you do that every day, then eventually you&#039;re going to be the best swimmer in the world. Why aren&#039;t most people the best swimmer in the world? They didn&#039;t even get in the damn pool. And so most people should be wake up. Go to desk. Do something. Not social media. Not watching HBO or Game of Thrones. Just doing some damn work. Trying to move it forward. Trying to push. Eventually, there becomes an avalanche.


You want to post organically on your personal Facebook profile and fan page every second day. You know this is building up that momentum as well. Even at first, if you&#039;re not getting clients from this stuff just keep pushing. Push it. Invite your email list to a live webinar every month. This gets them live with you. Each time you do your webinar, every single time, you&#039;re going to get better at it. It&#039;s good practice. After you&#039;ve done it a few times live, you&#039;re going to be a machine.


Share a client case study with your email list and social followers every month. If you get a client and they&#039;re getting results, get a testimonial. Get them on the phone, record it if you&#039;re allowed to, ask them. Record it. You can have an audio testimonial. Or if they just give you a text you could just use that and put it next to an image of them. Put it on your website. Put it on your social profiles. Send it out to your email list. You know there&#039;s tons of different things you can do, but just do something. Get in touch with these people. Stay in front of them. Stir the pot.


Ask your new clients for referrals using our methods. We&#039;ve got four proven methods here and ask them. Ask your new clients using our methods because you want to plant the seed before the work begins. They&#039;re not going to give you referrals immediately because they haven&#039;t seen you work, but you want to plant that seed so that when we go to ask after the work is done the event is already foreshadowed. We already know what the answer is. That&#039;s how you work. Follow up on existing clients for their referrals. After we&#039;ve planted those seeds, let&#039;s go harvest them. Follow up. Get those referrals. With those new referrals, get them on the phone, strategy sessions, sign them up, ask for referrals from your referrals, start growing this thing.


Ask your existing clients for testimonials and then share those on your social profiles, email broadcasts, put them on your website. Get the word out. Really spread your message. Start really growing this platform of yours. It will seem small at first, but honestly, it starts to get out of control pretty quick. I mean I remember my platform, my list was about 3,000 people only 3 years ago. 3,000. I thought that was huge. Now it&#039;s almost a million. What the hell? I never thought that was going to happen but it&#039;s because I just kept going at this thing and I kept working at this winning formula. I was just relentless at it. Sometimes didn&#039;t think it was working. Sometimes it wasn&#039;t working, but I just kept at it and it grows. That snowball builds momentum. You want to rinse and repeat this same formula every month and make sure that you plan ahead so the only thing to do each day is execute.


So many entrepreneurs and consultants, they wake up and they&#039;re like, &quot;Oh, what do I do?&quot; They go to their desk. They open their computer. Then they go to Gmail. Fatal mistake. Now they&#039;re looking at all these emails and their brain is pinging everywhere. Now they go and open social media. Facebook then Snapchat then Instagram and good Lord, they&#039;re gone. They are out. You may as well write those guys off for three days. Don&#039;t do that stuff. Wake up. Open up your war map calendar. See what you put on there. If it says, &quot;10 direct outreach,&quot; do that. If it says, &quot;Facebook post,&quot; do it. Get it done. Then once that&#039;s done, then you can do whatever the hell you want but just make sure you set these 30/60/90 day plans in advance. Plot it on your war map calendar like this.


Make sure you&#039;re always plotting the next 90 days ahead. Always, and make sure you&#039;ve got special attention to the next 30. You know the 90 day forecast doesn&#039;t need to be too detailed, but the 30 day should be nice and detailed. The next seven days should be real detailed. You just want to keep working through like that. Drill down into these months. Make sure that you&#039;re executing on all of this stuff and make sure that you&#039;re doing something every single day to move the boat forward. Move the thing forward. If you just take small actions every day, amazing things happen. Like I told you, Michael Phelps, gold. Every day was wake up. Get in pool. If you do that ... He did that and he became the best swimmer in the world.


Pretty much all I&#039;ve done consistently is wake up, do some work. Sometimes it&#039;s a lot. Sometimes it&#039;s not that much. Sometimes I don&#039;t like it, but I&#039;ve learned to love it now. Over time it turns into an unstoppable force. So make sure that you&#039;ve got as many elements as you possibly can from this winning formula. Make sure you&#039;re always planning 30, 60, 90 days ahead. If you do that, I can&#039;t see any possible case how you couldn&#039;t be rich. Seriously. I don&#039;t think there&#039;s been anyone in history that&#039;s done this consistently and hasn&#039;t gotten rich. It&#039;s just whether you&#039;re going to do it or not.


Remember that it&#039;s not just Facebook ads that drives your consulting business forwards. Here&#039;s my monthly sales volume by source. A lot of people fall victim to thinking that it&#039;s just Facebook ads. That&#039;s not true. Here&#039;s where I get most of my clients from. Paid ads is 40%. Then organic Facebook 20. Direct outreach 20. List farming 20. If we add up those three 20s we&#039;ve got 60. So, organic methods account for 60% of my revenues. That&#039;s more than half. If you&#039;re only doing Facebook ads, you&#039;re only getting 40% of the pie. You&#039;ve got to be doing both. That&#039;s why we want to use that winning formula and we&#039;re making sure that we&#039;re getting a good mixture there. You have to have a good mixture. If you&#039;re just relying on one thing, it&#039;s going to break.


Remember to mix up organic and paid attraction methods and most importantly remember to focus on both short-term and long-term objectives at all times. We&#039;re always trying to make money and get clients now. But at the same time we&#039;re always trying to contribute to the big picture and we&#039;re trying to contribute to our platform and our asset and our reputation and all of these things because the people who only focus on the short-term, they get burned in the long-term. And the people that only focus on the long-term, well they get burned in the short and they never make it to the long. That&#039;s how it works. You have to be both big picture and small picture. Both now and future. Both short-term and long-term.


The consultants that manage to do that consistently always win. Like I said, if you can do that and you do it consistently, there&#039;s no possible case that you&#039;re not rich. You&#039;ve just got to commit to it, do the work, and make sure you&#039;re getting a good mixture of stuff in there. Make sure that you just commit to it. Remember that it&#039;s not just about what you say. What you say is really the least important. It&#039;s what you do that counts. So don&#039;t think that you need to go and talk yourself up more or say more shit. You probably don&#039;t. You probably just need to do more stuff and speak less. That is how you do it.


That&#039;s it for this training module. Thanks for watching. I&#039;ll see you in the next one right now.
