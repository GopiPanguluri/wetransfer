                        Hey, everyone. It&#039;s Sam Ovens here and welcome to week three, The Alchemy of Client Conversion. In this training module, we&#039;re going to cover the real meat when it comes to sales and the sales training which you&#039;re going to experience in week three. In The Alchemy of Client Conversion, we&#039;re going to discuss the art and the science of taking someone from an absolute stranger, who&#039;s never heard about you before, to a high-paying customer on one phone call. To do that, we&#039;re going to discuss the theory, and the art, and the science behind converting someone from a stranger to a client. Then, I&#039;m also going to show you my exact, step-by-step, word for word script.


This module is a real beast. I reckon this one module is worth 10 times the price of this program alone. In here, I show you exactly how to sell. Just with this one training alone, you&#039;re going to be able to go from a total novice who has never sold anything ever before to an absolute sales master who is routinely and systemically closing deals on the phone again and again. This video is extremely important. I&#039;d go as far as saying it&#039;s one of the top three most important videos in this entire training program. Make sure you watch this one in full. Make sure you pay close attention and take lots of notes.


Here&#039;s what we&#039;re going to cover. We&#039;re going to start off with, what is the alchemy of client conversion and why is it important? I&#039;ve told you the alchemy of client conversion is basically how we take someone from a total stranger to a high-paying customer on one phone call. We cover the theory, the art, the science, and I give you my script and everything.


Then we&#039;re going to talk about the science behind converting a total stranger into a high-paying client. I&#039;m really going to break it down and show you the exact science behind this. I&#039;ve done a lot of research into the human brain, into consciousness, into psychology and why human beings do things, and why human beings make decisions. I&#039;ve really taken everything from the world of sales, and everything from the world of brain, what&#039;s the word for it, like neuroscience, and everything from the world of sales and kind of just merged them together, and worked out a profound sales process, which works like nothing else I&#039;ve ever seen. I&#039;m going to show that to you here. I&#039;m going to give you the script and everything.


Then we&#039;re going to discuss important things to know about sales that nobody else is doing. I&#039;m going to tell you some really important things that you need to follow. I&#039;m also going to debunk some massive myths that people have spread out there in the marketplace about sales, so that you can keep a clear head and know exactly what you&#039;re doing.


Then I&#039;m going to reveal to you the alchemic conversion script. I&#039;m going to show you the exact script. You&#039;re going to be able to download it and you&#039;re going to be able to modify and adjust it for you in your niche. We&#039;re also going to ship you out a physical copy of this alchemic conversion script. We&#039;ve got a digital copy for you to download as well.


Then we&#039;re going to discuss handling objections. Objections are when people say, &quot;Oh, let me think about it,&quot; or, &quot;I&#039;ve got to ask my wife,&quot; or, &quot;Oh, I&#039;m not sure.&quot; Basically, people who don&#039;t say yes. We&#039;re going to talk about how to handle those objections. I&#039;m going to go over the most common ones. I&#039;m going to give you scripted responses to handle them. I&#039;m going to explain pretty much everything you need to know about sales in this one video.


Let&#039;s start off with the science behind converting somebody from a total stranger to a high-paying client. We&#039;ll start off with our client acquisition methodology, which we use here in the consulting.com training program. Here&#039;s our client acquisition methodology. We have two ways which we feed our funnel and pretty much kick off the whole process. One is paid methods, which is like Facebook ads and different types of paid advertising. We&#039;re going to cover that later in the training program. Another one is organic methods, which are free, easy to use methods to attract clients. We&#039;re going to discuss organic next week. That&#039;s the first part of the process and that&#039;s how we get our prospect&#039;s attention.


Then from there, they go to the value video. This is a marketing communication piece, which basically gets the message across. It resonates the message with our prospect so we can get their attention and evoke a response. We&#039;re going to cover that later on in the training program as well. Don&#039;t worry if you don&#039;t understand any of these pieces yet. Then the prospect is going to fill out a survey. They&#039;re going to complete a basic form and they&#039;re going to tell us some information about themselves, like how much money they&#039;re currently making, what their goal is, how committed they are to making a change, all of this stuff. We&#039;re going to cover that later in the training program as well.


Then finally, once someone&#039;s seen our ad, someone&#039;s been through our value video and been indoctrinated, and then once they&#039;ve seen our survey and they&#039;ve filled it out, then we do a phone call with them, a sales call. In this training video today, we&#039;re going to talk about the call. We&#039;re going to just absolutely master this call, because this call is the most important part of the entire process. You can be pretty bad at ads, and you can be pretty bad at making your value video, and creating your funnel and your survey, and everything. You can pretty much bomb everything, but if you&#039;re really good at sales calls, you&#039;ll never go hungry and you&#039;ll never, ever, ever have a fear about money like for the rest of your life.


If you know how to sell, you know you&#039;re always good. Like me, I know I can sell pretty much anything, so I don&#039;t have a single fear in the world when it comes to finances because I could just go and sell anything. I could sell someone else&#039;s products. I could get a job as a salesman and make a lot of money. Being able to sell is the most important thing in life and business, and we&#039;re really going to show you how to master it.


Now, let&#039;s discuss the science of converting a stranger into a client. Here on the screen, I&#039;ve got an image of a stranger and then turning them into a paying client. This is something which is totally misunderstood by everybody. I remember when I got started in business, I was like, &quot;Oh, that&#039;s impossible. You can&#039;t turn someone from a total stranger into a paying client, especially on one call. People have to get to know you first. You have to meet them in person. You have to do a proposal. These sorts of things take months.&quot; That was my belief.


The truth is that you can turn someone from a total stranger into a high-paying customer with one phone call, one 45-minute phone call is all it takes if you do it properly. Now, if you don&#039;t do it properly, then it could take years and you might never sell the person. I&#039;ve really reduced all of this into a precise and an exact science that anyone can follow. It just takes one phone call.


Let&#039;s discuss the psychology behind why people buy consulting services. Why do people buy consulting services? Here&#039;s our understanding of why people buy consulting services at a very, very, very basic level. This puts things in perspective for you because it&#039;s just so simple and you can really understand it like this. We have a person and they&#039;re in their current situation. You could just imagine you right now or any person just frozen in a moment of time. That is someone in their current situation. It&#039;s just me. These are my issues. These are my feelings, all of these things.


Then what happens is the person comes into contact with some stimulus. The stimulus is our ad. We might put a Facebook ad in front of them or we might use organic methods and get in front of them another way. Either way, somehow, we need to put some stimulus in front of a person. Then when the person comes into contact with the stimulus, we have an agitated current situation. The stimulus is designed to evoke a response. It&#039;s designed to make someone desire to improve themselves more or desire to solve a problem which they might have had, and they&#039;ve been avoiding, and sweeping under the rug. The stimulus is a marketing ad and a marketing message carefully crafted to really kick someone&#039;s bruised knee and really elicit a response from them.


I show you how to create marketing messages and ads later on in this training program, but also in week one, we would have worked on your marketing message as well. When your marketing message really resonates with your prospect because you&#039;ve done your research and everything properly, then you&#039;re able to take someone from their current situation, you put your message in front of them, and then you&#039;re able to agitate their current situation, and you get an agitated current situation.


What this looks like is it&#039;s their current situation and then they&#039;ve got a desire there. They&#039;ve got a desire to improve or they&#039;ve got a desire to fix a problem, and this creates agitation. It sort of creates some separation of this one whole and it starts to look like this. These two circles, the blue one is the current self and the red one is the desired self. At this point, when we&#039;ve just flashed the stimulus in front of the prospect, these things aren&#039;t very defined. They&#039;re not very clear. There&#039;s not a lot of clarity on this. They&#039;re far from separated. It&#039;s kind of just merged into one and it&#039;s creating a lot of confusion, a lot of pain, and a lot of agitation. This is what it looks like after the stimulus comes into contact.


Then we tell the prospect, when they see our ad or they see our organic outreach or whatever they do, then we tell them to fill out a form for a free call with us. Then, because they&#039;re in an agitated situation, they fill out that form because they want to hear how they can fix this. They want to hear how they can get out of this agitated situation. Then, after that, they&#039;re back in their agitated situation, they&#039;ve just completed the form, and then within one to three days, we have a call with them. I teach all about this later on in the program when we go into the marketing funnels, and the value video funnel, and all of that stuff. Within one to three days of someone completing that survey form, we get on a call with them. If it&#039;s within one to three days, they&#039;re still in this agitated current situation.


Then what we do is we jump on a phone call with them. I&#039;m going to show you in this module right here how we conduct that call. We have the phone call with them. Then, what we do on the phone call with them, using the script which I&#039;m about to show you, is we start to separate these two things, the current situation and the desired situation. Before we got on the call with them, they&#039;re in an agitated state. However, once we get on the call with them, this script and this process helps you bring some separation from this one whole.


What we start off by doing is clearly defining their current situation and their current state. We get some data points on that and we really check in and check their pulse to see where they&#039;re at now. Then what we do is we start to stretch this desired situation further and further apart from the current situation. Then, when we get it to a point that&#039;s stretched right out and separated, and the prospect is like, &quot;Yes, that&#039;s what I want,&quot; then we clearly define it. We define a timeframe and we define a number. Like, &quot;How much weight do you want to lose in 12 months?&quot; Or, &quot;How much more money do you want to make in the next 12 months?&quot; We really separate the current situation from the desired situation and we get clear data points for both of these things. That&#039;s what your role is on the sales call.


Then what we do is we carefully position ourselves and our offer as the vehicle to bridge the prospect from their current situation to their desired situation. What we do is we get on the phone with someone who&#039;s in an agitated state because they&#039;ve been in contact with our stimulus, which is design to elicit a agitated state. Then what we do is we start separating the current situation from the desired situation. Once we&#039;ve got them nice and separated like that, and the prospect really wants to get to that desired state, we carefully position ourselves and our offer right in there as the vehicle to bridge this gap. That is our role on the sales call.


Here it says, &quot;The science of client conversion is creating separation from the agitated current state to two clearly defined and separated states. Once you have created separation from the agitated state, you must position you and your offer as the vehicle to bridge the gap between the two states. Truly masterful salesmen create separation from an agitated situation to a clearly defined current situation and a clearly defined desired situation. Then, they position themselves and their offer as the key to that desired situation. To put it simply, truly masterful salesman don&#039;t sell things. They sell futures.&quot; This is a profound lesson for many people in this program.


You&#039;re not actually selling what you think you&#039;re selling. If you&#039;re selling, it doesn&#039;t matter what you&#039;re selling, like if you&#039;re selling iPhones, you&#039;re not selling an iPhone. If you&#039;re selling coaching programs, or consulting, or personal training, or any of these things, you&#039;re not selling what you think you&#039;re selling. You&#039;re selling a future. You&#039;re selling a desired situation for this person, which they have in their mind. Now, the global economy ticks each day on people, the whole world waking up, and trying to buy a better version of themself. What we do on the sales call is we help people who are in an agitated state, we help separate their desired state from their current state, and then we position ourselves and our offer as the vehicle to bridge that.


A profound lesson is that we&#039;re selling futures. We&#039;re selling people the future that they want and that they desire for themselves. When you make the transition from selling things to selling futures, everything will shift for you. You will start to make a seriously large amount of money when you can make the shift. This module right here is going to show you exactly how you can do that.


Here&#039;s a pinup for this video, because this is one that you do not want to forget. This is available for download. You can print it off and put it on your wall, below this video in the resources section. It says here, &quot;The art of sales is to create separation. Truly masterful salesmen create separation from an agitated situation to a clearly defined current situation and a clearly defined desired situation. They then position themselves and their offer as the key to that desired situation. Truly masterful salesmen don&#039;t sell things. They sell futures.&quot;


Now, here&#039;s some important things to remember. Now, the first one is, you can consume this training module in two hours but mastery takes a lifetime. It&#039;s really important to remember that because I&#039;m going to show you everything you need to know about sales. I&#039;m going to give you the script. I&#039;m going to explain the science and the methodology and everything. You&#039;re going to have to come back to this training video and watch it again and again. Just this week, you&#039;re probably going to have to watch it three or four times. Then, every week after that, you&#039;re probably going to want to watch it every single week.


The people that have done the best in this training program, the people that have made six figures and the people that have got to seven figures, they kept coming back to this training program. They kept coming back to this one training module. They watched it again and again and again. They really drummed it into themself. They really made this training a part of them, so that it just became natural and instinctive. That&#039;s one massive point I want to get across to you. Don&#039;t just watch this in like two hours and think, &quot;Aha, I&#039;m done. All right, that&#039;s it.&quot; You&#039;re going to have to come back to this training again and again to really start mastering it.


Then, if you think you&#039;re not that good at sales and you&#039;re going to have issue with this sales process and this sales script, tell me, how many sales calls have you done? You&#039;ve probably done none. If you&#039;ve done zero, then of course you&#039;re not good at sales. If you&#039;ve done less than 30, of course you&#039;re no good at sales. You don&#039;t get good at sales, you don&#039;t get really good until you&#039;ve done a lot of calls. A lot of people think that I&#039;m born a good salesman. A lot of people think, &quot;Oh, Sam, he&#039;s just a natural salesman. He was just born with it or something.&quot; That&#039;s not true. I was scared of the phone. I was petrified of the phone. I couldn&#039;t even really be in the same room as the phone, let alone make a sales call, and let alone close anybody. If you think you&#039;re bad, believe me, I was way worse than you when I got started. I had no idea what I was doing and I was totally scared out of my mind.


How I got good is I did 1,600 sales calls. That&#039;s how you&#039;re going to get good too. You&#039;re going to start doing this training. You&#039;re going to come back to this video again and again and again. You&#039;re really going to practice it. You&#039;re going to do a lot of calls and you&#039;re going to master it. Understand that you&#039;re going to have to refer back to this training weekly for the next year. You&#039;re going to have to record your sales calls and learn from them, and practice, practice, practice.


What you&#039;re going to do is you&#039;re going to record all of your sales calls using call recording software, which I&#039;m going to show you in week three of this program, and then you&#039;re going to come back and revisit your calls and think, &quot;Where did I go wrong? What did I say right?&quot; Then you just want to do less of what doesn&#039;t work and more of what works. You want to optimize it. The words which you trip yourself up on, you want to remember what those are and then you want to practice them in front of the mirror, and practice them again and again so that you can get the words coming out smoothly, and you can get the words coming out with confidence.


Now, I want to cover something very important, called the ethical use warning. This is very important, so pay attention. This process is so powerful that you will have the ability to convince literally anybody to do anything. I ask that you use this process ethically and only sell to people you can actually help and add value to. Honestly, I could sell anything to anyone, even if I didn&#039;t know what it was, because I have the ability to position myself as a vehicle to somebody fulfilling their greatest desires. I ask you to use this sales process ethically and use it with warning and honestly. This sales process is profoundly powerful. This is not a joke when I put this warning in here. I want to make sure. I&#039;m going to teach everyone into a masterful salesman, but please make sure that you use it ethically, and please make sure you only sell people who you can actually help out and add value to. If anybody is caught using this in any bad way, then you are going to have a lot of trouble to deal with. Make sure that you use it properly, you use it ethically.


Now, let&#039;s discuss the before call preparation. Now, before the call, this is what you want to do. You don&#039;t want to forget this. A lot of people, they do this the first couple of times and then they forget, but these things are important, even if you&#039;re a veteran salesperson. The first one you want to do is release your attachment to the yes. Now, a lot of people, when they get on a sales call, they just want to close the person and they want to get a yes. They want to make money. There&#039;s nothing wrong with that, but it ruins the sales call. Quite often, when you get on a call and all you want is the yes, then you mess it up and you don&#039;t get the yes. What you want to do is release all of your attachment to the yes. You want to go onto the sales call without any attachment to closing the person.


What you want to do instead is put all of your attachment and all of your emotion and energy onto an accurate diagnosis. The best way I can describe this is with an example from the medical profession. You imagine that you go into a doctor&#039;s office. You walk in there and then the first thing that the doctor says is, &quot;Hey, I&#039;ve got these new drugs for you that just came in. They&#039;re really good. I think they can really help you out. They&#039;re really good drugs and you definitely need them.&quot; The first thing you&#039;re going to say is, &quot;Whoa, why do I need these things?&quot; In the medical profession, a prescription before diagnosis is malpractice or a prescription without diagnosis is malpractice. If a doctor started prescribing you things without accurately diagnosing you, then they would lose their job. They would probably go to jail and they could even kill somebody. In fact, if they did it for long enough, they definitely would kill somebody.


In sales, it&#039;s very much the same. The punishments aren&#039;t as harsh, but you don&#039;t want to get onto a sales call with an attachment to selling someone a particular thing. That&#039;s just like the doctor knowing that the next person that walks in the door is going to buy this drug. That&#039;s not how it goes. You want to have your attachment onto an accurate diagnosis. When you walk into the door and you come into the doctor&#039;s office, a good doctor will have all of his attachment on an accurate diagnosis. The doctor thinks, &quot;The next person who comes in, I&#039;m going to absolutely diagnosis things spot on.&quot; That&#039;s how you make a good doctor and that&#039;s also how you make good salesperson. You have all of your attachment on the diagnosis.


All we&#039;re trying to do is diagnose someone&#039;s issue. If we can help them, then we want to make them an offer. If we can&#039;t help them, then we just say that and we let them go. That&#039;s exactly how it works. You don&#039;t want to sell people who don&#039;t need your stuff, because it&#039;s just going to cause you problems.


You also want to keep your ego in check. It&#039;s so important that you don&#039;t judge people or you don&#039;t feel like you&#039;re better or you&#039;re worse than the person who&#039;s speaking on the phone. I&#039;ve had to train myself a lot, because when I get on these sales calls, I really have to bite my tongue. Some of the stuff people say is really crazy. People say wild things. Sometimes I&#039;m like angry. Sometimes I think the person is stupid. Sometimes I think this person&#039;s business is just an absolute disaster. I think all sorts of different things.


What is crucial is that I have to keep my ego in check. I can&#039;t say these things. If I say these things, or if I judge the prospect, or if the prospect feels, in any way, that I&#039;m judging them, then what happens is their guards go up. As soon as you put someone&#039;s guards up, then you&#039;ve lost forever. It&#039;s done. The sales call is written off. There&#039;s no hope in ever bringing it back. Once you flick someone&#039;s guards up, it&#039;s impossible to close them, even if they should buy your product, because now they&#039;re just going to fight to the death just to keep their ego.


What you want to do is make sure that you never judge the prospect and you never, in any way, be condescending or judgmental of the person you&#039;ve got on the phone. If you think the person you&#039;ve got on the phone doesn&#039;t have enough money, don&#039;t act like that. If you think they&#039;ve got way too much money and they&#039;re too big for you, don&#039;t act like that either. You just want to have your ego in check and you don&#039;t want to make any judgments.


Understand that you and the prospect are there for different things and for different reasons. You, you&#039;re on the sales call because you want to diagnose this prospect and see if you can help them or not. If you can, then you want to sell them what you have. That&#039;s what you&#039;re on the call for. Now, the prospect is quite different. A lot of the time we think a prospect is on the call to buy something from us and sometimes they are. More often than not, the prospect is on the call with us to get options. Prospects are constantly in option-hunting mode. They&#039;ve got a problem. They&#039;ve got a current situation and a desired situation. They&#039;re out there every day looking at different options. Once they see a good option, they store it to memory and they go out and they look for other options. Now, when someone gets on a sales call with you, the one thing they&#039;re going to want to do is take away an option. It&#039;s really important to remember that.


The other one is that you want to understand that sales is not a game. It&#039;s more meeting people heart to heart. A lot of people think sales is a game. It&#039;s like about tricking people, or having this little word here, or this little word here. It&#039;s not like that at all. I&#039;ve seen people who have practiced saying different things. They&#039;ve tried wearing different clothes. They try being really powerful or really aggressive on the phone. I&#039;ve seen people try every trick and gimmick in the book when it comes to sales. It doesn&#039;t work. It might make a difference of like 1%, but the real art of sales is meeting someone heart to heart. It&#039;s thoroughly understanding someone&#039;s current situations, thoroughly understanding someone&#039;s desired situation, and then just honestly telling them whether you can help them or not. If you can, getting them on board and working with them. That&#039;s what sales is about.


Now, here are some best practices when doing sales calls. First of all, you want to print out the survey 10 minutes before the call and look it over. When someone applies for a call with you, they&#039;re going to complete a survey. I&#039;m going to give you that survey and everything later on in this training program when we start building out your funnel, and your process, and all of that stuff. Don&#039;t worry about it now.


Then, what you want to do is be in a quiet room without noises and distractions. It is so important that you have a dead quiet environment. I hear of people doing sales calls in their car, or I hear of people doing sales calls with his dogs running around and barking, and kids crying, and doorbells ringing, and all sorts of rummaging around. Guys, that is just a surefire way to mess it up. No one&#039;s going to take you seriously if you&#039;re not taking the call seriously. One way to take a call seriously is to make sure that it&#039;s dead quiet and the prospect has your clear undivided attention.


You also want to use headphones, so that you can take notes and have your hands free to express yourself. When you use headphones, you don&#039;t have to hold the phone up to your head. When you&#039;ve got headphones on, that means that your hands are free. Throughout the call, you can take notes. I like to keep a moleskin notebook, just a small one which you can grab on Amazon, and we&#039;re also shipping you out the alchemy notebook in this training program. As soon as you get that, that&#039;s just like a moleskin notebook and you can take notes in that. What I like to do is have that open in front of me and I take notes throughout the call. I write things down. I put bullet points down and I write it all down. You want to take notes. Taking notes is extremely important.


The other thing you want to do is have your hands free so that you can express yourself. Now, when you&#039;re doing a sales call, if you want to get your tonality right, and if you really want to deliver your words carefully and properly, then you want to have your hands free so you can kind of move them around and express yourself as you speak. That works really well. It helps with the delivery of your message.


Then what you want to do is have in front of you just your notepad and the prospect&#039;s survey, so you have no distractions. In front of you, on your desk, your notebook, your alchemy notebook, and, printed out, your prospect&#039;s survey with the information about them. That&#039;s it. Then you can use your phone or Skype to call them. You&#039;ve got your headphones in and you don&#039;t have any distractions. You&#039;re not looking on your phone. You&#039;re not looking at a TV. You&#039;re not browsing around on your computer, none of that. You just want to give them your clear, undivided attention.


Then, what I like to do is I like to use audio only and I like to use the phone. This is so that I can use silence and complete focus as tools of persuasion. A lot of people like doing video calls, like on Skype or whatever, or Facebook live. I don&#039;t like that at all. I just like using the phone because it removes video out of it. It makes it way easier. You can use silence with a lot more power and you can also focus more because you&#039;re not distracted by the video. It&#039;s totally up to you. You can use video if you want to. If you&#039;re asking for my recommendation, I thoroughly recommend you just use audio.


Then, the last one is release all emotion from the day&#039;s stresses or previous calls and be in a tranquil state, ready to give your prospect your full, undivided attention. Guys, this is seriously important. When you get on a sales call with a prospect, you can&#039;t carry any baggage from the day with you. If you&#039;re having a really bad day or if you&#039;re completely broke and just terrified about money, or if the last five calls you did before this one all ended in nos, or if you&#039;ve got a headache, or whatever, you have to let go of all that. You can&#039;t bring stresses and all of this stuff onto the call with you. If you bring that stuff onto the call with you, you&#039;re going to mess it up. You have to get into the habit of getting into a calm, tranquil state, and just give your prospect your full, undivided attention for the entire call.


You&#039;ll notice this. This makes a massive difference in sales just alone. If you can give someone your clear, undivided attention, you&#039;re truly listening to them, and you&#039;re taking notes, and you&#039;re truly thinking, &quot;How can I diagnose this person? How can I help this person?&quot; The prospect will realize that. They&#039;ll notice it. Your words will start to resonate with them more and more, and it will help you close the deal. This is extremely important.


Now, this one is one of my favorites. This is using silence as your secret weapon. I&#039;ve sold a lot of people on the phone and I&#039;ve done a lot of sales calls. Other people started calling the silence that I use the Sam Ovens silence. A lot of people started saying that. What it is, is I use silence as my secret weapon and you&#039;re going to use silence as your secret weapon too. This is an extremely powerful tool. You won&#039;t even believe how powerful this is. It sounds so simple. It&#039;s like, &quot;What? Just being silent?&quot; Yeah, it&#039;s the most powerful tool you can possibly use in sales and persuasion.


When you ask a question, just shut up. If you ask someone like, &quot;Okay, with your business right now, how much money are you currency making per month?&quot; Once you&#039;ve asked your question, shut up. End it. I hear people all the time, they ask a question. They might say, &quot;Hey, how much are you currently making with your business per month right now?&quot; Then they kind of pause for a little bit and then they go, &quot;Oh, yeah, and also, what are using on Facebook? Have you tried this product called Unbounce?&quot; They start tacking on all of this other stuff. The prospect&#039;s mind is gone. The prospect&#039;s mind is pinging around all over the place now. You&#039;ve totally confused them. You&#039;re not going to get a clearer answer to your question.


Whenever you ask a question or whenever you speak, be quiet afterwards. End it abruptly. As soon as you say, &quot;How much money are you currently making per month?&quot; Silence. Don&#039;t speak again until your prospect answers the question. This is extremely important. You also want to let people finish their muddled sentences and never speak over the top of them. Your prospects are going to be speaking to you. They&#039;re going to be answering your questions. When they&#039;re speaking, never go over the top of them, even if they&#039;re totally muddled with their thoughts and their sentences aren&#039;t even making sense or whatever, just let them keep going. You never want to speak over the top of somebody else. Just wait until they&#039;re finished and then you can ask your next question.


Silence on your end allows the prospect to think that they will speak, giving you essential clues as to where their train of thought is leading. This is what you want to use as your ammunition. What this is, is when you use silence, if someone says a sentence to me and they&#039;re like, &quot;Oh, well ... &quot; Let&#039;s say I ask the question, I&#039;m like, &quot;So, John, how much money are you currently making with your business per month right now?&quot; He goes, &quot;Oh, I&#039;m not too sure. I think maybe like, uh, yeah, I&#039;m not too sure.&quot; If he says that, then I&#039;m just going to be silent. I&#039;m not going to say anything, because he didn&#039;t answer my question. I said, &quot;How much money are you currently making per month right now?&quot; He just said, &quot;Oh, I&#039;m not sure ... &quot; He just said some random stuff. I&#039;m going to be dead silent.


What that does is, he&#039;ll be like, &quot;Oh, that answer didn&#039;t satisfy him. I couldn&#039;t get off the hook that easily.&quot; He&#039;ll start tacking things on. He&#039;ll be like, &quot;No, actually, I think it&#039;s like $10,000 a month.&quot; You want to make sure that you&#039;re silent until they give you their full answer. It&#039;s really important. You want to make sure that you&#039;re silent even when they stop speaking. You want to give it a little bit of silence, because they might add some more on to the end of that sentence. Quite often, a prospect will start speaking, answering your question, stop, and then two seconds of silence later, they&#039;ll start filling in more of the silence because a lot of people are uncomfortable with silence. When someone&#039;s uncomfortable with silence, they&#039;ll keep speaking. When they keep speaking like that, they&#039;re giving us essential clues as to where their train of thought is leading. When someone just starts speaking to try and fill the silence, we really get to learn what issues they have in their business and what ares of their business and life they have sort of insecurities about.


Silence also makes the prospect worry that their answers are not good enough and that you might not take them on as a client. It flips the power to them being the needy troubled ones. This is really powerful. When you&#039;re doing a sales call and you&#039;re just silent, then the prospect thinks, &quot;Oh, man, is that answer good enough?&quot; Or, &quot;Does this guy like me?&quot; Or, &quot;Is this guy taking me seriously?&quot; Or, &quot;Man, maybe my answers are bad.&quot; Or, &quot;Oh, man, maybe this guy won&#039;t even accept me to work with him.&quot; It starts making people really go crazy.


You can remember back, I&#039;m sure, to when you were younger and when you sent text messages, or emails, or letters, or whatever. If you sent someone a text or an email and they didn&#039;t reply back to you, your mind starts going kind of crazy. It&#039;s like, &quot;Man, I wonder what happened. I wonder if that person still likes me. I wonder if this ... &quot; It starts going a little bit crazy. The same thing happens on a sales call, when the silence is nowhere near as long. We&#039;re not waiting days or weeks or whatever. We&#039;re just waiting a few seconds, sometimes 30 seconds or more, but in that moment of silence, the prospect starts to second guess him or herself and their answer and their situation. Once you can get the prospect tripping up on themself like that, you&#039;ve got it. Like, you&#039;ve nailed it. Once someone starts doubting themself on the call, you&#039;ve really got it.


It&#039;s extremely important to use silence. I know it sounds like just such a basic thing. You&#039;re like, &quot;Are you serious, Sam? You&#039;re going to tell us about silence and being quiet?&quot; Yeah. It does more than speaking could ever do. Make sure that you build this in and you really practice it when you do your sales calls.


The next one is to let people sit with the weight of their pain. Whatever you do, do not solve the prospect&#039;s problems and pains. I see this all the time. People get on sales calls and they think it&#039;s their job on the call to help the prospect out and to just solve all of their problems on the call. They start asking them situation questions. They&#039;re like, &quot;Okay, tell me, how are you currently getting customers? What problems do you have right now?&quot; As soon as the prospect says a problem they&#039;ve got, like, &quot;Oh, I&#039;ve got this problem with ads, Facebook ads,&quot; or something, the salesperson just dives in over the top and they&#039;re like, &quot;Oh, Facebook ads. Have you tried this? Have you tried bots? Have you tried video ads? Have you tried this, this, this?&quot; They just start solving the problem. It&#039;s like the salesperson was just waiting there, just for something which they could jump at and start a conversation about.


You can&#039;t do that. You are not on the sales call to solve the prospect&#039;s problems. You&#039;re not on the sales call to give advice, or educate, or coach, or train, or consult. You&#039;re not there to help them solve their problems or their pains. It is so important. It is crucially important that you do not solve. When your prospects state their current situation, their problems and their pains, do not jump in and start coaching or solving. Just say, &quot;Okay.&quot;


If someone says, &quot;I&#039;m having problems with my Facebook ads,&quot; or, &quot;I&#039;m really having problems with my diet or my exercise plan,&quot; just say, &quot;Okay,&quot; and that&#039;s it. You don&#039;t need to comment on it. If you comment on it, you start creating a bias in the prospect&#039;s mind. Whatever way you comment on it, you&#039;re going to skew their train of thought from there. If we just say, &quot;Okay,&quot; we&#039;re just acknowledging that we heard them and then we&#039;re allowing them to continue on with their train of thought without any bias on our side. We&#039;re just confirming that we&#039;re listening. It&#039;s important that we do this, because the train of thought inside the prospect&#039;s mind has to take its own route. We can&#039;t really force it and we definitely don&#039;t want to create any bias.


Your prospect has a problem. When you ask a question that dredges up emotion and pain attached to that problem, do not solve it. Then they no longer feel the pain. It is so important, to be a good salesman, and to be a closer, and convert people from strangers into customer, it is so important that you don&#039;t solve the pain. When you start asking someone questions and they start feeling bad about their situation, or they really start thinking, &quot;Oh, man, things are a bit worse than I thought,&quot; the last thing you want to do is jump in and be like, &quot;Oh, that&#039;s fine. Don&#039;t worry about it.&quot; Or, &quot;Oh, yeah, I&#039;ve heard everyone&#039;s got issues with that.&quot; Or, &quot;Don&#039;t worry. We can definitely help you with that.&quot; Don&#039;t say anything like that.


What it does is, the prospect, when they have this memory and they go back in their brain to this past time or this past event, there&#039;s pain attached to that. If someone swept a problem under the rug, and through our questioning, if we pull that problem out from under the rug, then along come the wave of emotions that are attached to that problem. When those emotions start rushing through the person, don&#039;t solve it. Let the problems and the pains sit there with the person. Let them sit with the weight of it. It&#039;s crucial, because we need this to be there if we want to close the deal. Just say, &quot;Okay,&quot; and let them keep asking their questions. Let them sit with the pain and the seriousness of their situation. We are not on the call to solve. We are on the call to diagnose.


A lot of people think that their role on a sales call is to solve it, and fix it, and to coach, and to show the prospect how smart they are, and how much they know. That&#039;s not what you&#039;re there for at all. You&#039;re just there to ask questions, take notes, and diagnose. When you go into the doctor&#039;s office and you&#039;ve got a problem, he or she will start asking you questions and writing things down, and they won&#039;t comment on it. They won&#039;t add their little tidbit or their little piece on the end of each one. They&#039;ll just say, &quot;Okay.&quot; This is so powerful because what happens is you start to think, &quot;Oh, man, are things worse than what I thought?&quot; Or, &quot;I hope things are okay.&quot; Or, &quot;I hope the doctor doesn&#039;t think I&#039;m unhealthy.&quot; Or, &quot;I hope the doctor thinks that I&#039;m being a good person.&quot; Or all of these different things.


When the doctor doesn&#039;t say anything back to you other than okay and just keeps his composure and starts taking notes, you kind of start worrying a little bit. You start freaking out. The last thing the doctor&#039;s going to do is be like, &quot;Oh, no. Don&#039;t worry about that.&quot; That&#039;s going to keep you feeling really good, when there might be an issue. If there&#039;s an issue, the seriousness of it needs to be there so that you will do something about it.


Now, let&#039;s talk about the magic and the science behind this process. What we do is we get onto a sales call and the prospect has a scattered, frustrated mind. The prospect has come into contact with some stimulus through our ads, either our paid ads or our organic ads, and what&#039;s happened is that&#039;s kind of got their mind scattered and frustrated. There&#039;s all these things buzzing around in their head, like, &quot;Do I go for this goal or do I go for that one?&quot; Or, &quot;Will this action create, make this goal happen or is it this action?&quot; It&#039;s a big scattered mess between all these different goals, all of these different possible outcomes and desired futures, and all of these possible actions to make those futures and desired outcomes happen.


When the prospect gets on the call, their mind is scattered and frustrated. Then what we do is we, through our strategic questioning and our conversion script, which I&#039;m going to give you very soon in this video, through asking the right questions, we&#039;re firing the right neural path. By stepping the prospect through these different states and asking them these different questions, we&#039;re stacking up all of these different neural paths inside their brain and firing things the right way so that we&#039;re walking them through all of the essential stages, so that at the end, they say yes and it&#039;s a no-brainer. Then, at the end, once we&#039;ve done our questions correctly and once we&#039;ve been through our script and all of the stages, what we achieve in the mind of our prospect is a perfected state of clarity and decisive action.


When someone comes on the call frustrated and scattered, and then we are able to get them into a state of clarity, then that&#039;s perfect because now they&#039;re ready to act. If the prospect comes on, they&#039;re like, &quot;This is it. This is exactly what I want. Wow. This guy was able to state things clearer than I was able to state them myself. He thoroughly understands my problems, my business, my situation. He thoroughly understands everything. He knows where I want to get to and he knows how to get there. This is my guy. This is it.&quot; When you bring about that state of clarity, the prospect has decisive action. When you do this correctly, the prospect just says, &quot;Absolutely, let&#039;s do it,&quot; because there&#039;s no reason why they wouldn&#039;t. You&#039;ve positioned yourself as the vehicle to get them where they want to go and it really is just a no-brainer.


Now, let&#039;s talk about why this process is architectured the way it is. On the screen here, I&#039;ve got some pictures of some people wearing these brain-scanning devices. They basically track brain activity when humans are doing different exercises and different activities. I really dug in and researched all about consciousness and brain activity and all these different things, and especially when it&#039;s applied to the art of salesmanship and when people are trying to make financial decisions. This is fascinating because human minds are not made to multitask. When somebody multitasks, their brain lights up like this and actions get tangled with goals. All of the processing power goes to the front of the brain, which is responsible for switching tasks.


Here in this diagram, we can see that they might have goal A, in red, and then they&#039;ve got action A. This is simple. When it&#039;s just one thing, they want goal A, and so action A will make goal A come true. It&#039;s very easy. It&#039;s a very easy process. As soon as they throw in goal B, then they have action B, and this is on the other side of their brain. Now, they&#039;ve got a mess here. They&#039;ve got two goals and two actions, and things start getting tangled up. The brain can&#039;t work on two things simultaneously. It has to go forward in the brain to the part of it which can switch tasks. That part of the brain then goes, &quot;Okay, now it&#039;s time to work on A.&quot; Then it goes, &quot;Okay, now it&#039;s time to work on B.&quot; What happens is it takes time to do that and it takes energy and brainpower.


The front of your brain, which switches between tasks, it&#039;s very small and it&#039;s not actually that strong and that powerful. When someone&#039;s multitasking, they&#039;re pretty much only using like 5%, 10%, probably not even like 5% of their brain, way less than that. It really doesn&#039;t work. What this is to do with sales is, in order to convert your prospect, in order to get them to sign up, you must work through a linear process, which is carefully designed to trigger the right parts of the brain and connect all the dots in the prospect&#039;s mind when it comes to achieving their goals and bringing clarity to their frantic and painful situation.


When we move through the sales script, we have to move through one stage at a time and we have to get it answered. If the part of the sales script is supposed to bring in a data point, like a figure, or if it&#039;s supposed to bring in some emotion, all of these different things which I&#039;m going to show you, it is important that you do it. If you skip any stages in this sales script, it won&#039;t work. I&#039;ve really architectured this thing looking at neuroscience and everything so that we can start forging a path inside the prospect&#039;s brain that, when we get to the end, it&#039;s just the decision&#039;s already made. There&#039;s no way that the prospect can&#039;t say yes. That&#039;s what we do.


Here&#039;s the diagram I showed you before. We create separation. We have the clearly defined current state and then we have the clearly defined desired state. Then we position you and your offer in the middle to help the prospect bridge that gap. There&#039;s 12 parts to our sales script. You can see part 1, 2, 3, all the way across to part 12. When you go through these stages one by one and you do them correctly, you line this entire process up. When you do it properly, boom, the prospect converts and becomes a customer. It&#039;s very, very powerful. I can&#039;t stress how powerful this process is when you can do it correctly. When done correctly, this sales process successfully stimulates the prospect&#039;s mind and brings about a state of clarity and decisiveness so they can act and make an immediate decision. It is profoundly powerful.


Now, let&#039;s dive into the script. Let&#039;s show you the step-by-step process which I&#039;ve got to make all of this happen. The script is called the alchemic conversion script. Here&#039;s a image of it right here. Now, we are going to be shipping you this alchemic conversion script, so you&#039;re going to get a physical copy, which will arrive at your door with all of the other physical printed out training materials. We also have included a digital copy for download below this video. What I&#039;m going to do right now is walk you through the alchemic conversion script and explain to you how it works.


The alchemic conversion script is a clearly documented methodology and step-by-step process for converting a total stranger into a paying client with one phone call. Here&#039;s part one. We&#039;re going to go through the 12 parts one by one and explain how it works.


Part one is small chat for two to three minutes. When you first start off the call, you just want to talk about some real basic stuff just for like two, three minutes, maybe even like one minute, and then you&#039;re going to jump right into it. What I like to say is, &quot;Hey, John. How has your week been going?&quot; Or let&#039;s say I call John. I always recommend that you call the person. You should have their phone number and you should call them. Then they pick up and they&#039;ll be like, &quot;John speaking.&quot; Then I&#039;d say, &quot;Hey, John, it&#039;s Sam Ovens here.&quot; Then I&#039;d wait for John to reply. Then I&#039;d say, &quot;How&#039;s your week been going, John?&quot; Then he&#039;d tell me. Then I&#039;d say, &quot;Where are you calling from today?&quot; He might say Alberta or Omaha or Maine or London or whatever. You go, &quot;Oh, yeah? Cool. All right, well, we can dive right in and get started with this call if you want.&quot; Then your prospect should say, &quot;Yep, let&#039;s do it.&quot;


It&#039;s very short, very brief. We&#039;re not getting into conversations about sports games. We&#039;re not getting into conversations about anything crazy here. We&#039;re just asking a couple of small questions and then we&#039;re asking, &quot;We can dive right in and get started with this if you want.&quot; If they say yep, boom, we&#039;re in business.


Now, part two is setting the agenda and taking lead. Here we say, &quot;Okay, how this call will go is I&#039;ll start out by asking you some questions about your business and your application, which I have here. Then, if it sounds like I can help, and if it sounds like we&#039;re a good fit, I&#039;ll explain what I have to offer and how that works and everything. Then at the end, you can make a decision whether you want to be a part of it or not.&quot; Then I be quiet. Then what should happen is the prospect should say, &quot;Okay,&quot; or, &quot;Yep, that sounds fair enough.&quot; What we&#039;re doing here is we&#039;re telling the prospect exactly how it&#039;s going to go.


When we get on the call, we want to foreshadow the later events the are going to occur throughout this call. We also want to state our agenda. When we do that, we take control, we take power, we take the alpha position in the conversation. It is so important that you take the alpha role. In any sort of conversation, there&#039;s always an alpha and a beta. The alpha is the dominant one in the conversation and they&#039;re the one that is leading it. They&#039;re typically the one that&#039;s asking the question and then the beta will respond and answer the question. Then it&#039;s back to the alpha, back to the beta, back to the alpha, back to the beta. It is so important that you have the alpha role. If the prospect starts leading you and they start asking you questions, just dodge the question.


If the person gets on the phone and they&#039;re like, &quot;First of all, I want to hear about this, this, and this,&quot; I would say, &quot;Okay, how this call will go is I will start out by asking you some questions,&quot; and I just ignore their question. I pretty much just dodge it. I say, &quot;Okay, well, how this call will go ... &quot; Then, if they try and talk over me again, or if they try and ask another question, I&#039;ll just let them say it. Then I&#039;ll be like, &quot;Okay, well, how this call will go ... &quot; Then, until they accept my agenda by saying, &quot;Okay, yeah, that sounds good,&quot; until they accept my agenda, I&#039;m not going to do anything. I&#039;m not going to answer their question and I&#039;m not going to let them take control of the call.


If the prospect really wants to control it themself, if they&#039;re like, &quot;No, no, no, I don&#039;t want to do that. I just want to ask some questions and do this.&quot; I&#039;ll be like, &quot;Okay, well, I&#039;m sorry if I&#039;ve misled you in any way and you thought that this was just going to be a conversation where you could ask me anything you wanted, but these calls are for diagnosing situations and seeing if my business can help you in your business. If you wanted to just jump on this call and just ask me a bunch of questions, that&#039;s fine, but that&#039;s not how these calls go. I&#039;m sorry, but I&#039;m going to have to end this call with you now,&quot; and just end it. If the prospect is leading the call, you&#039;re never going to close it. If you don&#039;t have the alpha role, it&#039;s done. It&#039;s very important from the very beginning that you take that alpha role. The best way to do that is to state the agenda and take the lead by saying this sentence and getting their response, which will be, &quot;Yep, okay, that sounds good.&quot; Now we can move forward to part three.


Like I said here, you must have the alpha role immediately. Sales only happen when you have the alpha role and are leading the conversation. If the prospect starts the call leading you with questions, dodge them and restate the agenda before moving forward. Do not answer them. If you can&#039;t take the lead, just end the call. No conversation will ever close without you leading and holding the alpha role.


Now, part three. Figure out why they are here. Here we say, &quot;So, John, tell me what motivated you to take the time out of your day and schedule this call with me today.&quot; Very short and sweet question. Now, this is a very powerful question because what it does is it finds out why they&#039;re here, why are they on this call. This prospect has, think about it, they&#039;ve taken time out of their day to schedule a call and they&#039;ve showed up to the call. They&#039;re on the phone with us. We want to know why. We just want to take a shot across the bow and see if we can get to that gold immediately. Sometimes you&#039;ll ask this question and then the prospect will respond, and they&#039;ll be like, &quot;Oh, I saw your ad on Facebook,&quot; or, &quot;Your friend referred me. This is the problem that I&#039;ve got and this is the problem. I&#039;m really not happy with it and I know you provide this. I know that you are definitely the guy to solve this problem. I&#039;m really looking to get started.&quot;


I&#039;d be like, the person just told me everything. That&#039;s the best thing that can possibly happen is that we just get the full story about why the person&#039;s on the call and, right away, we can see why they&#039;re there. Sometimes, the prospect doesn&#039;t give us an answer that clearly. Sometimes, the prospect doesn&#039;t even really know why they&#039;re on the call. There&#039;s something which is kind of pulling them onto the call, because they&#039;re dissatisfied in some way or another and they&#039;ve got a feeling that you might be able to help, but it&#039;s not that clear to them.


With this question here in part there, we&#039;re just kind of taking a shot across the bow and seeing if the prospect will reveal to us exactly why they&#039;re here. If the answer is not so clear, or it&#039;s more mumbled or anything, that&#039;s totally fine. We can still write it down and then we can move on to the next part.


The next step is part four, understanding their current situation. In this section, the way you want to think about it is, you want to think that you&#039;re like a private investigator or you&#039;re someone who&#039;s hired to conduct a thorough analysis of someone&#039;s business. You want to ask all the questions you can to really thoroughly understand the person and their business and their problems and everything. You really just want to understand here. We ask some different questions, like, &quot;Okay, John. Tell me what it is that you&#039;re selling. What services are you selling? What products are you selling?&quot; Then I&#039;m going to write that stuff down.


Then I might be like, &quot;Okay, how are you pricing that? What are your prices?&quot; Then, &quot;Who is your ideal customer? Who is the person that buys this product or this service? Why do people buy your product or service? What&#039;s the big promise?&quot; We really want to know why, like why do people buy this. Then, &quot;What is the sales process from stranger to client with you?&quot; We want the prospect to walk us through how they get clients end to end, want to understand everything. This is a big one. If the customer or the prospect is selling multiple products or services, we want to know what makes up most of their sales volume.


When we ask, &quot;Okay, so what are you selling?&quot; If the prospect says like a range of different things, like they&#039;ve got four programs, or four products which they&#039;ve got, or maybe five or whatever, we want to understand which are the most important ones. We might want to say, &quot;Okay, out of those four products you told me, which ones make up the majority of your sales volume?&quot; I see people make this mistake all the time. The prospect will say their four or five products or services they have, and then the sales person will latch onto just one of them, one out of the four. Then they&#039;ll spend the rest of the call kind of probing around that one product or service, and then positioning themself as the solution to sell more of this product or service. Then they&#039;ll get to the close and the prospect won&#039;t buy.


It&#039;s because the product or service which they latched onto and started using as ammunition throughout the call only makes up like 5% of the prospect&#039;s sales. If you are positioning yourself as someone who can help someone sell a product which doesn&#039;t matter to the company, they&#039;re not going to say yes. Quite often you&#039;ll find that one product or service which a company has is making up 80% or 90% of all the money they make. It&#039;s like the 80/20 principle. We see that everywhere. we want to know what that one thing is, because that way, we can understand which product or service we&#039;re going to talk about throughout the sales call.


You want to make sure that you&#039;re writing all of this stuff down and forming an accurate picture and understanding. You&#039;re going to spend quite a bit of time in this section here. I would say you could spend five to 10 minutes really just asking questions and thoroughly understanding the prospect and their business. It&#039;s impossible to sell someone something unless we understand who they are and what sort of business they have. That&#039;s what we&#039;re doing in part four. It&#039;s important to take notes here, because you just can&#039;t remember this stuff and you&#039;re going to use it later on in the sales call.


Then part five is to gather data and cause self-inflicted pain. Here, something really cool starts to happen. If you&#039;ve ever been to the doctor&#039;s and they start asking you questions, let&#039;s say we go into the doctor&#039;s office and we&#039;ve got a flu or a cold or whatever. The doctor&#039;s like, &quot;Okay, when was the last time you had a checkup?&quot; You say and he&#039;s like, &quot;Okay, what&#039;s your diet been like recently?&quot; Or, &quot;Have you been going to the gym?&quot; Or, &quot;How much water are you drinking? What time have you been going to sleep? What time have you been waking up?&quot; The doctor&#039;s not judging us in any way. They&#039;re not responding to any of our answers. They&#039;re just asking questions. Through the very nature of asking those questions, and us answering them, we start to feel kind of guilty. We&#039;re like, &quot;Oh, man. I haven&#039;t been eating very healthy. Oh, I&#039;ve been going to bed late. Oh, I probably could be drinking more water.&quot; This is what we&#039;re thinking as we answer the doctor&#039;s questions.


It&#039;s very powerful because, without being judgmental or without even saying anything, through very good questioning, we can start to make the prospect cause self-inflicted pain upon themself. If we try and cause pain for the prospect, it&#039;s not going to work. We&#039;re going to put their guards up and they&#039;re going to protect themself. The call&#039;s over. It&#039;s done and written off. It&#039;s like if you went into the doctor&#039;s office and the doctor was just like, &quot;Oh, well, you don&#039;t look very healthy today. You&#039;re definitely not drinking any water, are you?&quot; Or, &quot;Are you even sleeping?&quot; Or, &quot;What&#039;s wrong with you?&quot; If the doctor started saying that to us, we&#039;d be like, &quot;Whoa, what&#039;s your problem? I&#039;m leaving here. I&#039;m going to another doctor.&quot;


The same thing happens on sales calls. We need to make the prospect feel uneasy about their situation and we need to make the prospect feel some pain so that there will be some urgency there to solve that, but we can&#039;t create that by judging them. The only way we can do that is by asking questions and getting the prospect to cause pain for themself.


Here&#039;s some different questions we can ask. How are you currently getting customers? Do you know how much it&#039;s costing you to get a new customer? Do you have a proven process in place to get new customers at will? Are you comfortable relying on this style of running your business? Then, how much money are you making per month with this business right now? This last one is in bold with an asterisk next to it because you must get the answer to this question before moving forward. We need an exact data point and unitive measurement. If they don&#039;t know, get them to think. They must tell us. They must say a number.


If you&#039;re selling business consulting, then the data point which you want is how much money are they currently making per month right now. However, if you&#039;re doing some sort of fitness, or diet, or health consulting, then you really need another data point. You need like, how much do you weigh right now? Or, how many days out of a month would you say are you feeling happy or not stressed? Or, how many good night&#039;s sleep are you getting a week? We need some unit of measurement so that we can get a solid data point for their current situation. If we understand their current situation just with words, that&#039;s good, but it&#039;s not precise enough. There&#039;s nothing we can really use to measure it. We need to get all of the words, but then we also need to get a number and a unit of measurement.


In business, it&#039;s how much money are they making per month. With other sorts of consulting, you have to find a data point that&#039;s going to work for you. It&#039;s so important that we get that data point. If we don&#039;t get it, then the sale is not going to close, so make sure you get it. I know a lot of people are kind of uneasy about asking people, &quot;How much money is your business making per month right now?&quot; Seriously, in the world of business, it&#039;s a normal question. It&#039;s not something which people are cagey about. It&#039;s not like we&#039;re asking an employee what their salary is. We&#039;re just simply asking, how much money are you making per month right now? The business owner will tell us. Very simple. You want to write this down.


Then part six, figure out what they want. Here I say, &quot;Okay, John. Where do you want to grow this business to in the next 12 months?&quot; I&#039;m asking John where he wants to take this business. If you&#039;re selling a different type of consulting or coaching, where do you want to get your health and fitness? Or, where do you want to have your diet or your body? Or, where do you want to have your relationship in the next 12 months? We&#039;re getting them to think out into the future and tell us what they want. What do they want? What&#039;s their dream? What&#039;s their goal? What&#039;s their desire? You absolutely must get an answer to this. What you want to do is hear them out and then get a specific dollar figure per month where they would like to be at. Just like we got a data point for their current situation, we must get an exact data point and a unitive measurement for their desired future situation, whether that&#039;s dollars, pounds, whatever. We need a unitive measurement, because that makes it measurable. Just a bunch of words is not measurable.


Now, we&#039;ve got their current situation. We understand the context around it with the words. We also understand a data point of where they&#039;re at. Now we understand their desired situation in the future. We understand it with words and the context that surrounds it, and we also understand the data point. Now, with the two data points, we can accurately measure and determine the distance between these two points.


Then what you want to do is say, &quot;Okay, and what&#039;s your motivation for getting to $10,000 a month?&quot; Let&#039;s say I go, &quot;Okay, John. Where do you want to grow this business to in the next 12 months?&quot; Let&#039;s say John&#039;s currently at $0 a month. John wants to get to $10,000 a month. He says, &quot;That&#039;s where I want to be in 12 months.&quot; Then I go, &quot;Okay, and what is your motivation for getting to $10,000 a month?&quot; Then I just be quiet and John will tell me. He&#039;ll say, &quot;Oh, well, you know, I just want to have some money. I&#039;m starting to worry. I&#039;ve got to pay rent. I don&#039;t have much savings.&quot; He might tell you a bunch of stuff like this. You want to find out the motivation for someone achieving a particular goal. It&#039;s not enough to just understand the goal. We want to understand the motivation behind it. Every goal has a story and every goal has some sort of emotional drivers behind it. We want to understand those.


Then, &quot;How would things be different for your business if you got to $10,000 a month?&quot; We want to ask this question, because then the prospect is going to say how it would help them and how things would be different. This is really important because it&#039;s starting to get the prospect to think out into the future, and think, &quot;Imagine if I did achieve that. Things would be way better.&quot; It&#039;s start to paint the picture of how things could be in the future if the prospect achieved his or her dreams and achieved his or her goals. It&#039;s getting them to kind of future pace and add detail and color to that future vision.


Then we say, &quot;Would getting to $10,000 a month have an impact on other areas of your life?&quot; Then we be quiet. Then they might tell us. They might say, &quot;Oh, yeah. If I started making $10,000 a month, then I could look after my dad, because he really needs to retire.&quot; Or, &quot;I could probably start going to the gym more because I&#039;d love to get in better shape.&quot; Or, &quot;Oh, I could get back into fishing,&quot; or whatever. You want to get them to tell you how making more money or losing more weight or whatever is going to impact other areas of their life. When we just are talking about someone making $10,000, it&#039;s pretty boring on its own and it&#039;s often not enough for someone to buy something.


This is why we ask these other questions. We say, &quot;What&#039;s your motivation for getting to $10,000 a month?&quot; We get the information behind that. Then we want to say, &quot;How would things be different?&quot; We want to understand how they would make changes to their life if they had achieved it. Then we want to understand how it would impact the rest of their life. Now, we&#039;ve got a full, vivid, detailed picture about what they want and why it&#039;s important. Also, with us going through this process with the prospect, the prospect has started to paint the picture in their mind too. We&#039;ve taken them from a part of the call where they were feeling kind of in a lot of pain, because we were talking about all their problems, and we were asking them a lot of questions. We really got an accurate data point of their current situation.


Now, we&#039;ve kind of flipped it on its other side and now we&#039;re talking about out into the future, and how big things could be, and how the prospect achieving his or her dreams would have an impact on their whole life. We&#039;ve got them to go from a very kind of negative point of view to a very positive point of view. We&#039;ve created a very stark contrast between these two things. In this part, what you want to do is support the prospect in defining their vision for the future. You want to spend some time exploring it and clarifying it with them. A lot of the time, when you get on the call with your prospect, they don&#039;t have a clear vision for their future. Most people don&#039;t set goals. Most people don&#039;t know what they want today, tomorrow, this week, this month, this year. Most people don&#039;t know what they want with their life.


If someone doesn&#039;t have any desire, then it&#039;s pretty much impossible to sell them anything. If they only have a small desire, then it&#039;s also pretty much impossible to sell them anything. It&#039;s important that we thoroughly understand what they want. Then, if they&#039;re aiming too low, we want to help them aim higher. We want to widen what&#039;s possible for them beyond what they can see for themselves. In this part, you can start to use case studies or stories of people that you have helped so that you can help your prospect see a bigger vision of what&#039;s possible.


Say my prospect is currently at $0 per month. He wants to get to $10,000 a month. Let&#039;s make it smaller than that. Let&#039;s say my prospect is currently at zero and they want to get to $2,000 a month. That&#039;s a pretty small goal. I would say, &quot;Okay, I think that you could actually aim a lot higher than $2,000 a month. You know, I had a client who was in the same niche as you called Andrew and he started with me when he was making $0 a month. Within like six weeks, he got up to $20,000 a month. He was in the exact same niche, the exact same situation as you. There was also this guy called Jared who did the same thing. I&#039;ve helped people make this transformation. It&#039;s definitely possible. I&#039;ve seen it happen. I think you&#039;re kind of shooting yourself in the foot by only aiming for $2,000 a month. I think you could really aim for like $10,000, $20,000 a month.&quot; We&#039;re using our case studies or stories of people we&#039;ve helped to help the prospect see a bigger vision of what&#039;s possible, and to really help stretch it.


If you don&#039;t have any case studies or anything, it doesn&#039;t matter. You can still help the prospect stretch their vision of what&#039;s possible without case studies. You can just start saying to them, &quot;I think you could aim a lot higher than that.&quot; Plain and simple, if somebody doesn&#039;t know what they want and can&#039;t get an accurate picture of it, with a data point and units of measurement attached to it, they are unlikely to buy. Plain and simple. That&#039;s why it is extremely important to explore that vision of the future and explore that desired state and desired situation with the prospect. Get it vivid. Get it detailed. Get a data point for it. Then we can move on to the next part.


Part seven. This part is profoundly powerful and it&#039;s called releasing control and self admission. Here I say, &quot;Okay, John, you&#039;re currently at $10,000 a month and you want to go to $50,000 a month. Tell me, what&#039;s stopping you from achieving that on your own?&quot; This is a extremely powerful question. At this point of the call, we&#039;ve got on there and I&#039;ve clearly defined John&#039;s current situation. I understand how much money he&#039;s making, what his problems are, all of this stuff, and he&#039;s felt the pain. Then I&#039;ve explored the desired situation that John wants, the idea future that he wants, and he wants to get to $50,000 a month. We&#039;ve really explored that. Now, what I&#039;m doing is I&#039;m asking John what&#039;s stopping him from achieving that on his own. This is really, really, really important and really powerful, this one question.


Remember how I showed you this, right? This diagram about why people buy. We&#039;ve got a clearly defined current state. Then we&#039;ve got a clearly defined desired state. Then we have this thing in the middle called the gap. The gap is the distance between the desired state and the current state. This is the cause of all frustration, pain, all of this stuff. Now it is so important that the prospect tells us why they can&#039;t do this on their own. The biggest thing that makes sales calls not end in a yes and just blows them is because the prospect believes they can do it all on their own. If you just explore someone&#039;s current situation and their problems, then you explore their desired situation, no one&#039;s going to hire you if they think they can do that on their own. It&#039;s so important here to get the prospect to release control and self admission.


What we do is, you will have remembered from week one, when I told you about the three reasons why people buy consulting. Number one is an inability to get there on their own. They&#039;ve tried before, they&#039;ve failed, or they don&#039;t know how. They&#039;re unable to get there on their own. Number two is they want to get there faster, so they might believe that they&#039;re able to get there on their own, but they don&#039;t want to do that because they want to get there fast. They know if they hire someone else, they&#039;ll get there faster. Number three is they want to use a proven system and have guidance from somebody who has actually done it. They want to just follow an expert. They know if they try it alone and they haven&#039;t done it before, then there&#039;s a very high chance that they&#039;re going to mess it up, it won&#039;t work, it might take time, and it&#039;s probably going to be a waste of time when they could have just hired an expert anyway. They want to use a proven system.


These are the three reasons why people buy consulting and coaching services. When we&#039;re doing the releasing self control or releasing control and self admission, we&#039;re really getting the prospect to say, we&#039;re trying to get them to say one of these three things. We&#039;re really looking for one of these three magic responses. Releasing control and self admission, part seven. &quot;Okay, John. You&#039;re currently making $10,000 per month and you want to go to $50,000 per month. Tell me what&#039;s stopping you from achieving that on your own.&quot; You&#039;re listening for those three magic statements before moving forward. If they don&#039;t think anything is stopping them from doing it on their own, you will not be able to sell them because that is the biggest objection. If they think they can achieve success on their own, say, &quot;That&#039;s awesome.&quot; If that&#039;s the case, they won&#039;t need your help and you can try to end the call.


If someone&#039;s like, &quot;Oh, nothing&#039;s stopping me from doing that on my own. That&#039;s easy. I can do it.&quot; I&#039;ll be like, &quot;Okay, John. That&#039;s awesome. It doesn&#039;t really sound like you need my help then. I guess there&#039;s no point doing this call.&quot; Just like that, I kind of just end it. That&#039;s very powerful, because what happens is the person&#039;s like, &quot;Oh, what? No, no, no. I want to hear what you&#039;ve got to offer.&quot; I&#039;m like, &quot;What&#039;s the point, John? You just said that you could do all this on your own. You know what to do. Why don&#039;t you just do it?&quot; It&#039;s important that I end the call here if the prospect believes they can do it on their own. If the prospect comes around and says, &quot;Okay, you&#039;re right. I need someone who&#039;s done it before,&quot; then sure, I&#039;ll keep advancing the call, but I need one of those three magic statements or words to that effect.


They don&#039;t need to be those exact statements, but they need to be something similar to those statements, so that we can advance the call forward. If we don&#039;t get the prospect to release their control and self admission, then we can&#039;t close them. If there&#039;s any inkling of thought that the prospect believes that they can do this on their own, they&#039;re not going to pay us to help them.


Then part eight, gaining commitment and wrapping in emotion. Here I say, &quot;Okay, John, so you&#039;re currently making $10,000 a month. Why not just stay where you are?&quot; This is a powerful question, because someone could just stay where they are and we want to know why they don&#039;t want to stay where they are. That might get them to say like an emotional thing. They might say, &quot;Oh, I can&#039;t. I can&#039;t stay here. I can barely cover the bills and I&#039;ve got a newborn, which I need more money for.&quot; Or, &quot;I&#039;ve got a kid who&#039;s just about to go to college and I want to pay for their tuition and all of this.&quot; It&#039;s important to ask, why not just stay where you are right now? These questions are designed to wrap emotion into the conversation. Logic alone is not enough to get someone to make a decision. We need logic and we also need emotion. We need feelings to wrap in and help create this neural pathway in the prospect&#039;s brain.


&quot;Okay, is not having this affecting any other areas of your life?&quot; Here, this question, the prospect might say, &quot;Yes, it&#039;s affecting my personal life. I&#039;m stressed. I&#039;m worried all the time. I&#039;m not having as much fun.&quot; Or, &quot;I&#039;m not looking after myself. I&#039;m not going to the gym. I&#039;m not eating well.&quot; They&#039;ll start asking things like that. &quot;Okay, when are you wanting to fix this?&quot; We ask them a timing question. We&#039;re looking for someone to say the answer, &quot;Now. I want to fix this now.&quot; It&#039;s important that we understand the prospect&#039;s current situation, their desired situation. It&#039;s important that they admit to us that they can&#039;t do it on their own. It&#039;s also important that we understand that they want to do it now. We&#039;re really listening to make sure they give us a question that&#039;s about now.


If they don&#039;t, if they give us a question which is like later in the year or in a month or whatever, just end the call. Just say, &quot;Okay, you know what? It doesn&#039;t really sound like this is a good fit.&quot; They&#039;ll be like, &quot;What? Why isn&#039;t it a good fit?&quot; &quot;You said this isn&#039;t something you want to do right now. I recommend that you just reach back out to me in a month&#039;s time or six months&#039; time.&quot; There&#039;s no point in us giving them the option to buy if they&#039;re not going to buy. We&#039;re listening to the answer to this question so that we can determine whether we advance the call further and give them the option or whether we just end the call here and keep the option.


Then we ask the question, &quot;Okay, I know that you&#039;re wanting to fix this now, but how committed are you to making this happen?&quot; The response to this question always brings in the emotional drivers. Responses like being a single mother, or having just gone through a divorce, et cetera. There is always a powerful underlying reason why somebody wants to make more money in their business and you need to uncover that here. You really need to understand that. We&#039;re looking for someone to say, &quot;This is affecting other areas of my life. I want to fix this now and I&#039;m extremely committed.&quot; We&#039;re looking for those sorts of responses here.


Then part nine, acknowledge the gap and get permission to share. Here we go, &quot;Okay, John. I can definitely help you with that. I think you&#039;re a good fit for what I do. Would you like me to tell you about that?&quot; Then we just be quiet. We wait for the prospect to say yes. We&#039;re saying here, &quot;I can definitely help you with that. I think you&#039;re a good fit.&quot; Then we&#039;re getting permission to share. We don&#039;t just want to start talking about ourself. We want to ask them and they want to say, &quot;Yes, I do want to hear about that.&quot; Then we&#039;re like, &quot;Okay.&quot; Then we tell them in this next section.


Part 10, state what you are an expert at. Here we say, very simply, &quot;Well, my area of expertise is helping blank to blank by blank.&quot; We completed this in week one where we created your marketing message. You could say, &quot;My area of expertise is helping accountants to get more customers through Facebook advertising.&quot; Or, &quot;My area of expertise is helping single men who are struggling to find dates to get back into dating and find a girlfriend through going out and learning all of these different dating tips.&quot; &quot;Typically, I work with accountants who are struggling to get clients and I help them to get a lot of clients. We do this through Facebook ads.&quot; Here, we say our blank to blank by blank statement, and then we say, &quot;Typically, we work with these people and we help them to achieve this.&quot;


What&#039;s important here is you want to say, &quot;Typically, I work with,&quot; and describe the prospect&#039;s business here. &quot;I help them to,&quot; and state the desire that they have there. Here, when we&#039;re stating what we&#039;re an expert at, we&#039;re saying, &quot;I help the prospect to achieve the result which they want to achieve through what we do.&quot; It&#039;s perfect. It&#039;s like, &quot;Whoa, this person does exactly what I&#039;m looking for. This is my guy or this is my girl,&quot; because we&#039;ve carefully engineered it that way. What you want to do is script out how you present yourself and practice it until you can deliver it clearly and in a powerful way. You want your prospect to think, &quot;That&#039;s me. That&#039;s my situation right now. I definitely want to achieve that result.&quot; Therefore, you must be the expert to help them here. You want your statement here to sound perfect to the prospects, where they&#039;re like, &quot;This is it. This is exactly what I&#039;m looking for.&quot;


When you say your statement, you want to state it powerfully and with conviction, and then just shut up. You want to practice saying this sentence in front of the mirror, practice with other people, get it really rolling off your tongue smoothly, and say it powerfully, and with conviction.


Now, something quite strange happens. The tempo changes from this point forward. The dynamics of the conversation kind of shift. Up until this point, you have asked questions, and they have responded, and you&#039;ve said, &quot;Okay,&quot; and then just asked the next question. Now things change. You state what you&#039;re an expert at and then shut up and wait for them to start pulling more from you. At this point, you have led them into a mental state that they have never been in before. They know they have a problem. You&#039;ve explored the depths of their problem and you&#039;ve dredged up the pain and the emotions that come with that problem. They know what they want and you&#039;ve explored the vision of what they want. You&#039;ve explored that desired future. You&#039;ve also put a data point there. They know that they can&#039;t get there on their own. They&#039;ve admitted to you that they can&#039;t achieve this desired situation which they want and that they need help. Then they know that you are the expert to help them get there. They&#039;ve just heard you say your &quot;I help blank to blank by blank&quot; statement and it was perfect for them. They&#039;re like, &quot;Well, this is my person,&quot; but you are no longer leading the conversation forward. They have to pull it all from you, which again, builds their neediness while strengthening your power.


You imagine a conversation that goes like this. We&#039;re leading the conversation and we&#039;re getting the prospect to be open with us. We&#039;re thoroughly diagnosing their current situation and their pain. Then we start exploring their desired situation and how awesome life could be. Then the prospect is telling us that they can&#039;t achieve that on their own. Then we say we&#039;re the perfect guy for it and everything is just looking amazing. Then, we don&#039;t say anything. It&#039;s kind of like we&#039;re just quiet. It&#039;s kind of weird. It&#039;s like the prospect now has to come to us. They start fishing for all of the information. Before, we had to fish for the information because we needed to bring this current state of consciousness to them. Now that they&#039;re here, they&#039;re hungry for what we have and we need to flip that power and flip that dynamic. Now, they start pulling from us and it just makes the situation all that more powerful for you.


Part 11, stating your offer and how it works. The next step, when you do this correctly, is that your prospect will ask you how they can work with you or what you have to offer. When they ask, you need to present what you have in a clear way that does not solve their issues or their problems. Here you state what you do and how it works. You must talk about it at a high level and keep it vague, but not too vague to the point where they don&#039;t understand. You want to be very careful that you talk about it at a high level view, so you don&#039;t trigger the feature brain, but you also don&#039;t want to make it just sound like you don&#039;t know what you&#039;re talking about. You want to keep it high level. You don&#039;t talk about the processes or the features or anything like that, because you will trigger the wrong feature brain in your prospect and you want to keep their brain fixated on the outcome.


If my prospect knows that he wants to make $10,000 a month, but I start talking about Facebook ads and funnels and all of this, then he&#039;s probably going to think, &quot;Oh, Facebook ads. I&#039;ve heard about that before.&quot; Or, &quot;That doesn&#039;t work. I&#039;ve tried that.&quot; Or, &quot;That doesn&#039;t work.&quot; We&#039;re triggering all of these different things in their brain, which is not what we want to do. We want to avoid that stuff, because all the prospect should be thinking about is the outcome. That&#039;s all that he or she really cares about. Your description of how your thing works should be no more than two minutes and it should be delivered clearly and with confidence. You want to write out how you&#039;re going to describe what you do and you want to practice saying it again and again and again, so that you can roll it off your tongue smoothly. It shouldn&#039;t be clumsy and it shouldn&#039;t be more than one to two minutes. It should be nice and high level.


Then, when you finish saying that, just shut up. These conversation dynamics are quite different now. Before, we would ask a question and then be quiet. Then the prospect would respond. However, now, we state what we do and then we be quiet. There&#039;s not a question at the end. It kind of messes with the prospect a little bit, because he or she is like, &quot;What? There wasn&#039;t a question on the end of there.&quot; Now, they have to come to us and ask the next question before we give them the next piece of information. Now, your prospect will start asking you questions about how it works. They will keep asking questions until they have a clear understanding of how it works and, more importantly, how it will work for them.


When you present your offer in vague detail but still enough detail to be of interest, the prospect then asks you for all the pieces they need to understand. They keep asking until they have the full picture that they need. As you answer the questions, be careful not to divert the conversation. Just answer the specific question that they asked you and then shut up.


Eventually, when your prospect has asked all of the questions they have regarding the offer, they will ask you the price question. This is a magical part of the script, because there is a lot of detail and information about what we offer. We could talk for probably a day about all the different things that we have in our offer. We could say, &quot;Oh, well, with Facebook ads, I do this and I do that. I use this software and I do that.&quot; We could talk for hours, but the prospect isn&#039;t interested in that. I see this all the time. I see sales people who give presentations and they just tell the prospect everything about their product. They&#039;re like, &quot;Oh, well, it does this. It does that. It does this.&quot; They say all of this stuff, but the prospect doesn&#039;t care about any of that stuff.


What we do, this is a masterful thing which I created, is we state what we do at a vague high level and then we let the prospect ask questions about the offer. When the prospect starts asking questions about the offer, they&#039;re pulling from us the pieces that they need to understand it. Now, this works so well, because the prospect is only asking the questions which they&#039;re interested in and they&#039;re getting the answers which they&#039;re interested in. To them, our offer looks like their perfect offer. However, if we just start talking about our offer and all of the stuff which is involved, they might start thinking, &quot;Oh, well, I don&#039;t need that. I don&#039;t need that. I don&#039;t need that. Whoa, I don&#039;t need a lot of stuff in this offer.&quot;


If we state it vaguely and then they ask us, then we tell them, by the time they&#039;ve stopped asking their questions, they&#039;re like, &quot;Whoa, this is exactly what I need. This is all of it.&quot; We got them to design the offer themself through their questioning. Through their questioning, they were able to pull only the information they wanted to know and leave all the other information out. Of course, in our offer, there is a ton of other stuff, which they will be getting, but there&#039;s no point in us explaining all of that stuff to them when they&#039;re not interested in it. It&#039;s just a bunch of words which are useless. There&#039;s no point in using them. This is a profound shift in sales methodology, which no one is using. It is so powerful.


You make sure that you don&#039;t ever talk about the price until the prospect is done with all of their questions. You&#039;ll be surprised at how many questions the prospect has when they&#039;re trying to understand your offer. I see sales people blow this all the time. They start explaining what their offer is, and then once they&#039;re finished explaining, they say, &quot;Oh yeah, and it&#039;s $5,000,&quot; or, &quot;It&#039;s $2,000 a month,&quot; or whatever. The prospect wasn&#039;t ready to hear the price. They hadn&#039;t got their head around what it was first. If they didn&#039;t know what it was that you were selling, and now they know it&#039;s $2,000, now they&#039;re like, &quot;Whoa, $2,000. That&#039;s expensive. I don&#039;t want that.&quot; They&#039;re going to be like, &quot;Oh, no. Actually, you know, I don&#039;t need this. I&#039;ll see you later,&quot; because you gave them the price at the wrong point.


If someone doesn&#039;t understand something, any price is expensive for that. When someone thoroughly understands something and now they ask for the price, $2,000 could be a steal for it. This is another profound shift in sales methodology. We don&#039;t say the price. They have to get it from us after they are finished asking us the questions to form a full picture of our offer, perfected for them and their situation.


Part 12, stating your price with incentive based pricing. This part comes only when your prospect asks for it. They&#039;ll be like, &quot;Okay, how much are we talking here? How much does this cost?&quot; Then, if you&#039;re selling a one-off service or a one-off coaching program, you could say this first one here. &quot;Well, the everyday price for this is $9,800. I have found that those who make decisions quickly always turn out to be the best clients and we do amazing work together. For that reason, I have something called incentive based pricing, where if you make a decision on the call with me today, I&#039;ll knock $4,000 off the investment and it&#039;s just $5,800.&quot; Then we shut up, into silence.


Then, if we were selling a monthly recurring service like a monthly retainer service, we could say this. &quot;Well, my fee for managing this for you is $2,000 per month and there is a setup fee of $2,000. I&#039;ve found that those who make decisions quickly always turn out to be the best clients and we do amazing work together. For that reason, I have something called incentive based pricing where, if you make a decision on the call with me today, I&#039;ll waive $2,000 off the setup fee and it&#039;s just $2,000 a month.&quot; Then shut up.


This silence is the most crucial part of your entire call. You must not cave in. You must remain silent until the prospect speaks. Sometimes this silence is longer than one or two minutes, and I&#039;m not joking. I&#039;ve had silences that are like longer than two minutes. I&#039;ve had to mute the phone because I can hardly keep myself from just making a noise because the silence is so intense. You just have to be quiet. Once you state the price, zip it. Whatever you do, don&#039;t add anything in over the top. Let them squirm under the pressure. This is it. If you get the sales call up until this point and you&#039;ve done it correctly, this moment here is crucial.


At this point, your prospect knows they have a problem. They know what they want and they have admitted that they can&#039;t get there on their own. They see you as the leader and the expert with the solution to get them where they want to go. You covered your offer and let them extract every detail they needed to know about it. Now, they have asked you about the investment. Then you&#039;ve stated the price and then shut up. Now their brain is in serious overdrive, just running mental movies of what might happen if they buy, and what might happen if they don&#039;t buy, and it&#039;s thinking about their bills, like what bills are coming up, what payroll is coming up. It&#039;s thinking about everything. It&#039;s thinking about their cash flows, how much money they&#039;ve got in this account, that account, how much they could pull from this credit card or PayPal. Their brain is just going 1,000 miles an hour. It&#039;s just like ... They&#039;re doing a lot of thinking right here.


They&#039;re basically thinking whether they can pull the trigger on the investment. You must let them sit in the pressure of silence to process this. If you come in and you start saying anything, you&#039;ll blow it. You have to let them sit with the pressure. If they say, &quot;Okay,&quot; or, &quot;Okay, well,&quot; or anything like that, just remain silent. You&#039;ll hear this quite often. You&#039;ll hear the prospect say, &quot;Okay. Yeah, okay.&quot; They&#039;ll just keep saying things like that. You just don&#039;t say anything. Be dead silent because okay isn&#039;t an answer. They&#039;re trying to get off the hook. By saying okay, they&#039;re hoping that you&#039;re going to come in and be like, &quot;Oh, yeah. Have you heard about this?&quot; Or whatever. They&#039;re getting out of that tough spot, but you can&#039;t say anything. You&#039;ve just got to be quiet.


It can be hard, so you&#039;ve got to use that mute button on your phone. When you mute it, you can be like ... Or you can say something and it kind of lets go of the pressure of that moment. Otherwise, it&#039;s quite, for people who are brand new, the silence can be quite a lot of pressure for them. If they ask if you are still there, say, &quot;Yes, I am.&quot; Then just shut up again. Don&#039;t let them get off the hook. If they say, &quot;Are you there?&quot; Be like, &quot;Yeah, I&#039;m still here.&quot; That&#039;s it. They&#039;ve still got to answer the question about whether they&#039;re going to sign up to this program or not, but we&#039;re not going to say anything. This is so powerful. I can&#039;t explain how powerful this is. When you can do this, you will feel like Superman on these calls, because it&#039;s so powerful. This is how you close. You&#039;ve got to lead the call the right way. You bring it right to this moment. Get them to ask you about the price. You state the price and then you&#039;ve just got to be quiet. Then you can&#039;t say anything.


Here&#039;s what we&#039;re aiming for. Any words that mean, &quot;Let&#039;s move forward with this,&quot; and they could be anything, like, &quot;Okay, what&#039;s the next step?&quot; &quot;Okay, what&#039;s next?&quot; Or, &quot;Okay, how do we get started?&quot; Or, &quot;Okay, let&#039;s do it.&quot; Anything like this. When they want to move forward, you could say, &quot;Awesome. We can get you started right now if you want,&quot; and be quiet. Then the prospect will be like, &quot;Okay, how do we do that?&quot; &quot;Okay, how do we do the payment?&quot; Or words to this effect. Then you say, &quot;We can do credit card over the phone if you want,&quot; and be quiet. Then they&#039;ll be like, &quot;Okay, cool,&quot; or, &quot;Okay, let&#039;s do it,&quot; or any words to this effect. Then you say, &quot;So, is that Visa or MasterCard?&quot; That&#039;s it.


Then they&#039;ll think about it. They&#039;ll be like, &quot;Okay, Visa,&quot; or MasterCard and they&#039;ll get it out. You&#039;ll be like, &quot;Okay, what are the first four digits, and they&#039;ll start reading it out to you. You write them down. Later on in this training program, I&#039;m going to show you a credit card processing service which you can use so that you can process credit cards yourself. You can process it online, or over the phone, or whatever, and you can collect the money via credit card. I strongly recommend using credit card because it allows you to instantaneously get the transaction done over the phone.


Here&#039;s what we will not accept. Any words that do not mean yes or no. This decision must be binary and not a gray area. Here&#039;s what we won&#039;t accept, &quot;Okay, well, can you send me something via email?&quot; Or, &quot;Okay, how do I get back in touch with you if I decide to move forward?&quot; &quot;Okay, I&#039;m going to need to think about this.&quot; Or, &quot;Okay, I&#039;m going to have to ask my business partner,&quot; wife, et cetera. This is what we won&#039;t accept. This decision must be binary and not a gray area. The absence of a yes is a no. A no is fine, but a maybe is not. The absence of a yes is a no. If somebody says that this is too expensive, or they can&#039;t do this, that&#039;s fine. That&#039;s absolutely fine. We like nos. At least a no is a no, and we can forget about it and move on.


We also like yeses because we can sign them up and we&#039;re good. What we don&#039;t like is maybes, things that get stuck in that limbo zone. Ask them why they can&#039;t and then see if you can handle the objection. Nos are fine. It&#039;s the maybes that we don&#039;t want and will not accept. Looking back over my data, anything that wasn&#039;t a yes on the call really turned into a yes later. Even if it did, the if it&#039;s needed to convert it was more than what was needed to convert a new prospect. You must create a reason for people to buy now on the call and never let a single call linger in a maybe zone. Nobody in their right mind will turn down a $2,000 discount just so that they can think about it. If somebody says they want to think about it, make sure that they understand that, after the call, the $2,000 discount goes away. If somebody still doesn&#039;t mind about the $2,000 discount, they were never going to buy anyway, so forget about them.


Now let&#039;s talk about why people don&#039;t buy, because some people don&#039;t buy. Most people don&#039;t buy. They have a problem and life would be better if they were making more money, but life has been tolerable up until now and they will still be just fine tolerating where they are right now. People don&#039;t buy because they retreat to fine. This is what I call the retreat to fine. On the sales call, we&#039;ve talked about their current situation and how it&#039;s bad. Then we&#039;ve talked about their future desired situation and how that&#039;s awesome and that&#039;s where they want to be. However, someone won&#039;t buy because they will just retreat back to their current situation and be like, &quot;I can live here. It wasn&#039;t that bad. I can still stay here.&quot; That&#039;s what we call the retreat to fine.


You must not let people retreat to fine. When people retreat to fine, you have to show them the seriousness of their situation. You have to tell them how things just can&#039;t stay there because they just told you about how things really need to change. That&#039;s what you have to do. We&#039;re going to cover how to handle the objections in just a moment. They must make a decision. People will do everything they can to get the option to do something in their own time and at a later date. The option is what the prospect wants. The prospect just wants to get that option and take it home, but don&#039;t give it to them. Don&#039;t give them the option. Don&#039;t give people the option. Make them understand that a decision needs to be made to either move forward or put this matter to bed. Fence-sitting is in nobody&#039;s best interest.


If somebody can&#039;t made a decision and insists that they need to think about it, say, &quot;That&#039;s okay,&quot; but the absence of a yes to you is a no, and thank them for taking the time to do the call, but this is not a maybe. There is no option to think about it. You&#039;re going to mark them as a no and they can reach out at a later day down the line at the every day price. You have to let them know that, once they get off the call, that option is gone. You can&#039;t just go and think about it.


Now I want to show you the alchemic conversion script. We&#039;ve gone through all of the 12 stages of the alchemic conversion script, but now I&#039;m going to show you the full word-by-word sales script. At the end of this alchemic conversion script, I&#039;m going to show you the objection handling section, which shows you everything you need to know about handling those objections. What I&#039;m going to do right now is just pull this up. This is available for download below this video in the resources section, and also, we&#039;re going to be shipping a physical copy of this out to you.


Here it is. Inside, there&#039;s the title page, then there&#039;s the inside page, and then there&#039;s the pre-call preparation. Part one, the small chat, part two, state agenda and take lead. Now, I&#039;m just going to kind of walk through these quickly because I just walked you through all of these 12 parts on this training video. Then there&#039;s part there, figure out why they&#039;re here. Part four, understand the current situation. There&#039;s part five, gather data and cause pain. Then there&#039;s part six, figure out what they want. Part seven, releasing control and self admission. Part eight, gaining commitment and wrapping in emotion. Part nine, acknowledging the gap and permission to share. Part 10, state what you are an expert at. Part 11, state your offer and how it works. Part 12, state your offer with incentive based pricing. That is the entire alchemic conversion script, from part one all the way through to part 12, word for word, in detail, so that you can use this on your own. You can print this out, and have it next to you, and use it when you&#039;re going through these sales calls, which is really going to help you in a massive way.


Then what we&#039;ve got at the end is a special section on handling objections. Objections are things which the prospect says when they don&#039;t buy. They don&#039;t give us a yes. They don&#039;t give us a no. They&#039;re kind of like somewhere in between. It&#039;s either a question where they&#039;re fighting back or they&#039;re saying no and we&#039;re trying to convert them into a yes. Here are some of the most common ones.


&quot;How much time do I have to decide?&quot; Then we say, &quot;Well, how much time do you need to decide?&quot; And, &quot;Is there something in particular you need to think about that we can discuss right now?&quot; You want to flesh that out and talk about it. Then when you do that, it will likely lead to this. &quot;Well, I need time to find the money and look over my finances. I just don&#039;t make decisions on the spot. I need to check with my partner or my spouse.&quot; Then we can say, &quot;Okay, great. When specifically will you be talking with your partner or spouse?&quot; Or, &quot;When will you be looking over your finances?&quot; Or, &quot;When will you be sitting down to think about it?&quot; Then we can say, &quot;Perfect. You will have spoken with your spouse or partner or looked over your finances by noon Eastern tomorrow.&quot; Then you could say, &quot;Awesome. I&#039;ve just added you as a friend on Facebook. Just reach out to me there and get enrolled by noon tomorrow, and I will hold these savings for you until then.&quot;


If they can decide in 24 hours or the next day, we just set a specific time and day they need to enroll by and get the incentive price. We will still give them the incentive price if they enroll within 24 hours.


Then the next objection, &quot;I have no money.&quot; &quot;Okay, we understand that finances can be a challenge and we always do our best work to work with people in this scenario. Let me ask you this, is this something you really want to do? Because if it&#039;s not a good fit, that is okay too.&quot; Then they might say, &quot;No, I do want to do it.&quot; Then we can say, &quot;Okay, how can we make this happen for you?&quot; Then there&#039;s the next objection, &quot;I can&#039;t afford it.&quot; &quot;Tell me more about that,&quot; and then let them tell you. Really flesh out this answer. Then you could say, &quot;Okay, so you&#039;ve shared with me throughout the call that this is exactly what you need to do to move forward. Tell me, how is it that you are going to afford to continue without it?&quot; Then they&#039;re going to say, &quot;Well, I can&#039;t.&quot; &quot;So, how can we make this a reality for you?&quot;


The next objection, &quot;I don&#039;t have the money.&quot; &quot;Isn&#039;t that why you came on the call to begin with?&quot; A lot of these training programs or coaching services or consulting services are how a person can make more money in their business. If someone&#039;s got an objection that they don&#039;t have any money or they can&#039;t afford a way to make more money, there&#039;s madness. How can someone not afford to make more money? It doesn&#039;t make sense. We say, &quot;Isn&#039;t that why you came on the call to begin with?&quot;


Then there&#039;s another objection, &quot;Once I make some money, then I want to work with you.&quot; Then we go, &quot;Tell me how that would work,&quot; and let them tell you whatever they have to say. Then you could say, &quot;Okay, so let me see if I&#039;ve got this right. What you are saying is that you are going to continue to do what you have told me is building your business slowly, and isn&#039;t even paying your bills, and you&#039;re going to continue to do what&#039;s not working long enough to someday build up a surplus of cash to invest in what will work. Is that an accurate statement?&quot; Then they&#039;ll be like, &quot;Well, that sounds sill. I know.&quot; Then we&#039;ll be like, &quot;So, how can we make this work for you?&quot;


The next objection, &quot;I need some time to think this over.&quot; We say, &quot;I get that and I encourage that. We want this to be a great fit for everyone. Can I ask you this? What haven&#039;t we discussed that you still need to think about? That&#039;s why I take the time on these calls. I&#039;m here right now to help you make an empowered decision. While you still have me on the phone here, what questions or concerns do you still have that are unanswered?&quot; You can discuss those. If they can decide in a 24-hour timeframe or the next day, we just set a specific time and day they need to enroll by, and we can still give them the incentive based price.


The next objection, &quot;It&#039;s not a good time.&quot; &quot;Do you mind if I ask you a question about that? When will it be a good time for you to start putting the things you said are most important to you into your life?&quot; Or, &quot;How will you know when it&#039;s time to start doing and having the things in your life that you just told me were so important?&quot;


Next objection, &quot;I need to check with my partner or my spouse.&quot; We say, &quot;Yes, I totally understand. That is very important. Let me clarify here. Are you saying that you are in and you just need to get a sign-off from your spouse or partner and then we are moving forward, or is this something else?&quot; If yes, say, &quot;Okay, great. When specifically will you guys be able to talk?&quot; They they&#039;ll tell you. Then be like, &quot;Perfect. So, you will have spoken with your spouse by noon Eastern tomorrow, or by 11:00 AM Pacific tomorrow?&quot; Whatever they tell you. We just need to get an accurate data point. &quot;Okay, you&#039;re going to talk to your spouse when? Okay, what time, what day? When will you have a decision by?&quot; Then we could say, &quot;Awesome. I just friended you on Facebook. Just reach out to me there and I&#039;ll get you enrolled by noon tomorrow. I will hold those savings for you until then.&quot; We&#039;ll let them hold the incentive based pricing if it&#039;s within 24 hours.


If they can decide in 24 hours or the next day, that&#039;s fine. We still give it to them. Note, offer to get on the phone with the spouse and discuss it too. It works really when you do, just be sure when, if, they do come on the phone, that you don&#039;t start babbling about you. When they got on the phone, just be like, &quot;Okay, John&#039;s told me that he&#039;s really interested and that you&#039;re having some concerns about signing up. I totally understand that. I respect that. Why don&#039;t you tell me what your concerns are and I&#039;ll see if I can help you understand or address anything.&quot; You can help answer the questions that the spouse or the partner has. You can start the conversation by asking, &quot;Great. What questions do you have about us helping your husband?&quot; Or wife, et cetera. You get the point. You don&#039;t have to do a whole new strategy session all over again. You just want to get straight to the objections. The husband or the wife will have explained it to the partner. The partner will be on the fence with a couple of things. You just want to cut straight to those objections and handle them, so you can get this deal over the line.


Now, here&#039;s another objection. &quot;I&#039;ve been in other programs like this and I still haven&#039;t gotten the results I wanted.&quot; &quot;Well, there&#039;s somebody you don&#039;t trust, and it&#039;s either me or you. Which do you think it is? Let&#039;s discuss that. What specific outcomes would you need to see to make this totally worth the investment of time and resources? What would make this a complete no-brainer for you? That&#039;s exactly what we will be addressing.&quot;


The next objection, &quot;Do you have a guarantee?&quot; &quot;Absolutely. We guarantee that if you keep doing what you&#039;re doing, you&#039;ll get the same results. That&#039;s our guarantee. Now, with that said, we also guarantee that our system works. If you&#039;re looking for an out before you begin, then we&#039;re probably not a good fit for you, because that&#039;s really not the energy that will serve you or us. It&#039;s all good either way. Let&#039;s just be clear that you should either commit to this, with the attitude that it&#039;s going to work for you fully and completely, or you decide that it&#039;s not right for you at this time. If it&#039;s not a good fit, that&#039;s totally okay. But I can assure you this, people who are looking for a reason for something not to work usually find it.&quot; This is very true. If someone&#039;s really looking at reasons why this isn&#039;t going to work, they&#039;re going to find it anyway. It&#039;s best just not to deal with those customers at all.


Here&#039;s the magic question which we can use if our prospect&#039;s still on the fence and we really need to push them off the fence. We can say this. &quot;Look, the real decision that you are making isn&#039;t whether or not to coach with me or anyone else out there. That&#039;s really irrelevant. The real question and the real decision you have to make is whether or not you&#039;re ready to commit to having all of the things that they said that they wanted,&quot; which you put in here, &quot;or whether or not you want to continue having all of the problems and challenges,&quot; which they told you about here. &quot;That&#039;s the real decision that you are going to be faced with until you are ready to change.&quot; This is a magical question. It makes the decision about gaining what they want in life, not about coaching with you.


Like I said, people don&#039;t buy your services. People don&#039;t buy you. People don&#039;t buy your products. People are buying a future. People are buying out of the current situation and the pain which they&#039;re in right now, and they&#039;re buying into their desired future and the state which they want to be at. &quot;The real question is, do you want to stay with all the pain and all the problems or do you want to make a decision to fix this and to grow into what you&#039;ve always wanted to be?&quot; That&#039;s a powerful question we can use at the end if we need to get our prospect over the line.


I just walked you through a bunch of objections and scripted rebuttals, which I have put together so that you can handle them. Now, if you come up against other objections, then you should start writing them down and add them into your script. Now, I&#039;ve done my best to really put in a lot of objections here and show you how to handle them, but you will probably come up with some which I haven&#039;t got in this sheet here. That&#039;s totally fine. You can add them in and you can figure out the best way to respond to them. If you get some objections and you don&#039;t know how to respond to them, you can ask in the Facebook group or you can ask on one of our weekly Q and A calls which happen twice every single week. Someone will be able to help you there.


Over time, we&#039;re going to be able to really build on this document and build more and more rebuttals to different objections, so that everyone in this program is armed with an extremely powerful sales script, which has a ton of objections and ways to handle those objections. Right now, as it stands, this script covers a lot. It covers pretty much everything. We&#039;ve got all their different objections and then we&#039;ve got the 12 parts of the alchemic conversion script all here in this.


What you can do is you can download this and you can print it off right now. It&#039;s available in the resources section. We&#039;re also going to ship out a physical copy to your address. What we&#039;re going to do now is we&#039;re going to start editing this script so that it really matches you. What I&#039;ve given you is my script and what I use, but you might be in a different niche. You might not be selling business growth consulting. You might be selling health and fitness, or yoga, or meditation, or dating advice, or relationship advice, or any of these different things. That&#039;s totally fine. The script still works for you. It&#039;s still exactly the same. All you need to do is change around some of the words and some of the data points so that it matches exactly what you&#039;re selling.


Also, there might be some sentences in there which sound a bit funny when you say them. You might be in a different country where the culture is a little bit different or anything like that. That&#039;s totally fine. You can adjust the script so that it really fits for you, your niche, and your offer. That&#039;s what we&#039;re going to be doing in this next training module right now, which is called Editing Your Script.


In this training video here, I&#039;ve walked you through the alchemic conversion script. I&#039;ve shown you everything that&#039;s involved in here. I&#039;ve stepped you through all of the different stages of the sales call and explained exactly how they work and the psychology at each point. I&#039;ve also explained the science and the psychology behind this conversion script. This thing is profoundly powerful. It is going to be a secret weapon for you once you start using this thing. Like I said, I&#039;ve helped people go from total sales novices, who have never sold anything before in their entire life, and I&#039;ve helped people with stutters, people who are shy, people where English is their second language. You name it, I&#039;ve seen it. I&#039;ve helped those people go through this training, master this script, and they&#039;ve been able to go out there and start converting total strangers into paying clients on the very first phone call, which is something which is quite a massive transformation for someone to go through. That&#039;s how powerful this thing is.


Armed with this script, you are going to be dangerous on the phone. Like I said earlier, it takes some practice. What I want you to do now is print off that script and practice reading it out loud. Then practice saying the different sentences in front of the mirror. Look at yourself in the mirror and practice reading it. Get the sentences to roll smoothly off your tongue. Get your tonality right. Get the delivery strong and confident. Get the pauses right. Just start making it fluent. Practice it like it&#039;s kind of like a movie script which actors have to learn so that they can do their scenes in different movies. You really want to take my script and make it a part of you, and make it a part of your business, so that you can use it fluently and with confidence when you are doing these sales calls. That is extremely important.


Now, throughout the rest of the modules in week three, I&#039;m going to show you how to edit your script, really how to make it your own, and also how to team up with other people in this training program so that you can practice with them and do role playing. We&#039;re really going to turn you into a sales master in week three. That&#039;s pretty much the end of this video here where I walked you through the science and the art of converting someone from a total stranger into a paying customer. I also walked you through the alchemic conversion script. That really is the entire process there.


I just want to reiterate this one point again. It says here, &quot;The art of sales is to create separation.&quot; It says, &quot;Truly masterful salesmen create separation from an agitated situation to a clearly defined current situation and a clearly defined desired situation. They then position themselves and their offer as the key to that desired situation. Truly masterful salesmen don&#039;t sell things. They sell futures.&quot; Just remember that you&#039;re not really selling you and your product. You&#039;re really selling someone a desired situation and a future.


This script is engineered to really take someone from a situation like this, where they are agitated and they kind of want something but they don&#039;t really know what it is, they&#039;re kind of bouncing back and forward between these two things. It shows you how to take someone from this state, and how to get on a call with them, and how to really separate these two states, their current state and their desired state. Then it shows you how to position you and your offer as the vehicle to help the prospect bridge this gap. It is profoundly powerful. Make sure that you come back to this video multiple times.


Like I said, you&#039;re probably going to watch it just four times this week. Then every week for the rest of this year, you&#039;re probably going to come back and watch it every single week. The people that do the best in this training program, the people that make six figures, seven figures, and multiple seven figures, those people really come back to this script and this training video, and they watch it again, and again, and again. They really master the art of sales, to the point where they just build it into them and make it part of their natural state. Make sure you do that. Make sure you really submerge yourself in this and become a sales master. I can assure you, when you become a sales master, you will never worry about money for the rest of your life. You will never go hungry ever again. Once you can sell, you can pretty much make money at will, any time, anywhere. It is an amazing skill to have.


Thank you for watching this training video. Make sure you print out that script. Make sure you practice it. I&#039;ll see you in the next module right now where we&#039;re going to edit your script and make it your own. Thanks for watching.
