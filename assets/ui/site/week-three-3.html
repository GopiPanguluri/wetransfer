                        Hey everyone, Sam Ovens here and welcome to this video in the Consulting Accelerator program called Crafting Your Script. In this training video today, I&#039;m going to show you how to take the alchemic conversion script, the script which we&#039;ve provided to you in this training program and assure you how to take that and how to really turn it into your own by how to adjust it and how to iterate on it and improve on it so that you can really make it your own and make it a part of you so that you&#039;re really confident using it in your business and using it when you&#039;re talking to your prospects and bringing them on board into your services and then to your training programs.

Let&#039;s get right to it. Here&#039;s what we&#039;re going to cover today. First of all, why crafting your script and making it your own is extremely important. I&#039;m going to explain why you can&#039;t really just take mine word for word and then use it. I mean you can, there&#039;s nothing stopping you but, there are some small adjustments which you&#039;re definitely going to want to make so that you can really improve on it and make yourself a lot more comfortable using it.

Then I&#039;m going to show you our scientific method for iterating, improving and adjusting our sales scripts and we use this hypothesis action results feedback loop and iterative process and I&#039;m going to cover that. I&#039;m going to show you exactly how we use that scientific method for improving our sales script. Then I&#039;m going to show you the step-by-step process for adjusting the script. I&#039;m going to show you exactly how to make the changes. Where to make the changes and what those look like and everything for different sorts of niches, different sorts of offers.

Then I&#039;m going to show you why you should record all of your sales calls. Recording your sales calls is extremely important. I mean, you want to refer back to them all the time so that you can see we went well and we, you didn&#039;t go so well and you can make improvements and catch yourself making mistakes so that you don&#039;t make them again. I&#039;m also going to show you exactly how to go about recording them and how to go about saving them to your computer and filing them away so that you can refer back to them at later dates.

Then I&#039;m going to discuss some action items. We&#039;re going to discuss the iterative process used to evolve your perfect script. You&#039;re going to take the script which we&#039;ve provided to you in week three of this program and then you&#039;re going to use this iterative process to really make it your own and evolve it into what I call the perfect script. The perfect script is when you&#039;re 100% comfortable using it and it just flows and it&#039;s natural and it&#039;s like it&#039;s a part of you.

That&#039;s what we&#039;re going to be covering in this training video. Why craft the script and make it your own? Why not just use the one which I&#039;ve provided to you in this training? Well, sales using a script is similar to riding a bike and when you first start riding a bike, it feels foreign and you&#039;re shaky but once you get used to it and make some adjustments to things, it starts feeling more natural and then with enough practice and adjustment, the bike becomes a part of you and you don&#039;t even think about it.

I&#039;m sure you&#039;ve experienced this. When you were learning to ride a bike, I mean when you first got on, it feels totally wrong. It feels all totally uncomfortable, it feels foreign and you&#039;re shaking all over the place but with some practice, then you might move the seat up a bit or the seat down a bit. You might adjust the handle bars or whatever. With some adjustments and some practice and some time, the bike really starts to become a lot more comfortable.

Eventually, if you ride it enough, it really just becomes a part of you and you&#039;ll notice that when you&#039;re riding a bike, if you ride a bike a lot that you&#039;re not thinking about it anymore. You&#039;re not actively thinking, &quot;Okay, I&#039;m going to pull on the break here or I&#039;m going to push my left hand here and turn around this corner.&quot; You don&#039;t think like that.

When you really practice enough, the bike really becomes a part of you. It&#039;s like an extension of your body and you don&#039;t even really have to think. Everything is just natural and instinctive. Sales with a script is similar to riding a bike. When you first try it out, it feels foreign and you&#039;re a bit shaky but once you get used to it and make some adjustments to things, it starts feeling more natural and then with enough practice and adjustment, the script becomes a part of you that you can use naturally without even really thinking about it.

At the beginning when you start using your script, don&#039;t worry if you slip up a little bit or you feel overthinking or anything like that, it&#039;s totally normal but, I&#039;m telling you, when you adjust your script and you have some practice doing it, eventually it&#039;ll just be like riding a bike and it will become a part of you. The first few sales calls you do will feel a bit strange but, they feel that way for everyone.

Like I said a lot of people, I think a lot of people believe that salesmen are born, not made and that people who are amazing at sales, they&#039;re just naturally gifted. We&#039;ll, that&#039;s not true at all. I was horrible at sales when I got started and then I had to learn, I had to train myself and everyone else I know who&#039;s being through my training programs, none of them were awesome salesman when they came in.

They become awesome salespeople. If you do your first few calls and if you&#039;re using the script and it doesn&#039;t feel totally comfortable for you, don&#039;t worry about it. It&#039;s like that for everyone. You need to adjust the script. Make it your own and practice using it again and again to truly master it and truly make it a part of you. Now, let&#039;s talk about how to do that. The scientific method for crafting your script. Do you remember our scientific method for everything throughout this program?

This is a running theme throughout all of this consulting accelerator training program. We&#039;ve covered it with everything and it&#039;s how we iterate and improve our niche, our offer, our message and our mindset. It&#039;s also how we iterate and improve the sales script too. It&#039;s what I refer to as the Master Algorithm which we&#039;ve covered multiple times already and it looks like this.

At the start, you&#039;ve got the thesis then in the middle the antithesis and then synthesis at the end. Then you&#039;ve got feedback where the synthesis curves for background and feeds back into the thesis. That is the Master Algorithm. It could look like what&#039;s the most basic version of it. The thesis could be my current situation right now and I&#039;ve got pale skin because I&#039;ve been inside for too long.

The antithesis could be that I go outside into the sun and I lie in the sun for a few hours. The synthesis is when I get a tan and I ... That&#039;s because my skin has come into contact with the sun and then now I&#039;ve got a tan and that becomes the new thesis which feeds back around. That&#039;s a very basic example. We&#039;ve used this multiple times to help improve our mindset, to help improve our niche and our offer and our message and all of those different things.

What we do is the thing that makes humans unique is that we have the ability to form hypothesis. We can hypothesize about the outcome. We can think about the outcome which we want to achieve which is the green circle here and then we can hypothesize about what action could make that outcome happen. Once we&#039;ve set the hypothesis for outcome and action, then we go and take actual action. Then we receive feedback and we see what went right and what went wrong and then we improve and we iterate and we have a new thesis.

We go through this again and again and again. This is really the Master Algorithm for all evolution, natural selection, everything like that. It&#039;s how we evolve our offers, our message, our niche, also how we evolve our marketing message and our sales script and it&#039;s also how we evolve ourselves and our mindset. It&#039;s a very, very powerful tool.

Here it is. I&#039;ve adjusted this diagram specifically for improving and iterating on the sales script. In the beginning right now, you have an unedited script. That is the alchemic conversion script just as it comes to you in this training program. You&#039;ve got the unedited script that&#039;s your current situation. Then you&#039;ve got your actions which should be the sales calls, you&#039;re going to be doing real sales calls.

Then you&#039;ve got the outcome of those calls, the sales call outcome. You can also hypothesize about what the sales call outcome might be and you can also hypothesize about what actions you&#039;re going to take which will be doing the sales call and how you&#039;re going to do them. That is really the current situation right now. As you start to do some real life sales calls using the script, you will collect feedback and see what works for you and what doesn&#039;t work for you.

You will then start to make iterations and improvements to the sales script so that it suits you comfortably and becomes a natural part of you. Once you do it the first time, then you&#039;re going to have a revised sales script. Once you&#039;ve collected some feedback, you&#039;re going to change it a bit, you&#039;re going to revise it and then you&#039;re going to go out and do sales calls again. You&#039;re going to have more sales call outcomes, then you&#039;re going to have feedback again.

You&#039;re going to keep revising it, keep testing it, keep collecting feedback and it&#039;s an iterative process to really dial it in and get it honed and refined. I&#039;ve got a note on the screen here which says you will listen to feedback on the calls and then make iterations and improvements to your script again and again. This is how we get it. Awesome.

If you&#039;ve ever wondered how people just become master salesman and how people make multiple seven figures, eight figures and more, it&#039;s just because they really see it this optimization algorithm for themselves. They want a script and they want a powerful sales conversation that&#039;s going to convert people into customers so they set that algorithm and then they just go to work optimizing it and they keep improving and improving and improving.

It&#039;s amazing how quickly you can get really good at sales. Don&#039;t freak out and think, &quot;Oh, this looks like it&#039;s going to take forever.&quot; I&#039;ve seen people use this process within one week and become awesome at sales. It&#039;s amazing how quick it happens if you put it to work and if you really start using it. Truthfully, I&#039;ve done 99% of the work for you and I&#039;m not exaggerating at all when I say that.

Now, I&#039;ve really made it as easy as it possibly could be for you. Have you ever wondered how the sales script and sales training came to be? But how did it come to be this way? And how did it become so good? Well, I did thousands of hours of research, I read so many books, I did different training programs and I flew around the world going to different seminars and things like that.

I&#039;ve read all the stuff I can really find on sales and I&#039;ve done thousands of hours of research. Then I created different evolutions of sales scripts. If you saw my first sales script I ever used, you would laugh that it would look nothing like the one that I&#039;ve provided to you now and I&#039;ve been through dozens, probably hundreds of different evolutions of my sales scripts.

Then I&#039;ve done over 1,600 real life sales calls. Now, I&#039;ve got on the phone and spent like an hour, 45 minutes to an hour with that many people. I&#039;ve pitched that many people. I&#039;ve done five years of refinement and iterations to the sales methodology and the sales script. You imagine if you set that Master Algorithm up and you feed it 1,600 calls and then you gave it five years of time to iterate and improve.

Well, that is what I did and that&#039;s how I got the sales script to be this good and that&#039;s how I got the sales script to the point of refinement where it is right now. I had to start with pretty much a blank page and figure out what to say here, what to say here, what to say here, what to say here. I had to key through so many different variations to really find one which really stuck and one which really worked extremely well in the marketplace. That&#039;s the one which I&#039;ve just handed over to you in this training program.

It took thousands of sales calls, countless hours of research and five years of iterations and improvements to optimize the script to the point where you have it right now. What I achieved after 1,600 plus calls, you begin with today. To get to the point which took me five years and 1,600 calls, you get to start very first call at that point today. Like I said, I&#039;ve done most of the work for you, 99% of the work, you just have to make some small iterations and improvements and then just put it to work and practice.

You&#039;re already ahead of 90% of everybody else in the marketplace and all you need to do is adjust it and make it your own. I think a lot of people there fear that all these other people in the market who are going to be really good. Seriously, if you&#039;ve never sold anything before in your life and you just watched the sales training and you just take the sales script, you&#039;re already going to be better than those people who think they&#039;re really good sales people.

I&#039;m not joking at all. This thing is going to put you right ahead of the pack. It&#039;s going to put you at the forefront of everything because it&#039;s an insanely powerful script. Now, let&#039;s talk about the step-by-step process for integrating and improving your ... for iterating, sorry, and improving your sales script. Here&#039;s our step-by-step process for improving the script.

Number one is to start with the script as it currently exists and is provided to you in this training so you can go to week three video two which is the Alchemy of Conversion. You can watch the training there and you can download the script there and that&#039;s how it currently exists right now, and then you want to adjust the questions for your particular niche and their problems and desires.

What I&#039;m going to do right now is just pull up the script and show you the different places in the script which you&#039;re going to want to make some iterations and some improvements on. The pre-call preparation, it&#039;s pretty much going to be the same for every person in every different niche. Part one pretty much unchanged. Part two, unchanged. These things remain the same.

Part three, &quot;So John, tell me what motivated you to take the time out of your day?&quot; This is pretty much exactly the same. You&#039;re not really going to change this. Part four, understand the current situation. Here you can see I&#039;m asking questions about what they&#039;re selling because me, in my niche, I&#039;m helping business owners and consultants and coaches get more clients and really grow their business.

I&#039;m helping business people but there&#039;s a lot of people in this training who aren&#039;t selling to business owners or business people. They&#039;re not in a niche where they&#039;re providing anything to do with financial gains at all. It doesn&#039;t matter if you&#039;re selling yoga coaching or wardrobe consulting or personal training consulting or relationship advise or anything like that.

The script will still work for you. You just have to make some adjustments to it. Here is where you&#039;re going to start making the first adjustments. Understanding the current situation. You want to change these questions around here so that you&#039;re asking questions about their current situation and their niche. I&#039;m asking, &quot;What are you currently selling? Who&#039;s your ideal customer?&quot; All of these things, if you&#039;re in the dating niche, you would say, &quot;Okay, tell me how you&#039;re currently going about getting dates and going out and meeting a woman.&quot;

Or if I was in the health and fitness niche it would be, I&#039;d say, &quot;Okay, tell me how you currently are exercising?&quot; Or &quot;Are you not exercising at all? Just tell me what that looks like right now.&quot; Right? I&#039;m going to be asking a series of different questions to thoroughly understand the person&#039;s current situation. What you want to do is you can download the script, you can just edit it, you want to adjust these questions here in part four.

Then part five, gather data and cause pain. You want to adjust these questions here too. Here I say how are you currently getting customers? Do you know much it&#039;s costing you to get a new customer? Here you would ... If you were in the health and fitness niche you&#039;d say, &quot;Okay, tell me how are you currently planning on losing weight?&quot; or &quot;How are you currently planning on getting fit?&quot; Or, &quot;How are you currently planning on finding a girlfriend or getting dates with woman?&quot;

You can adjust these questions. It&#039;s very simple. It&#039;s very simple and straightforward. It doesn&#039;t have to be about money. I think a lot of people believe that because my script is this way that theirs has to be that way too and they can&#039;t sell things that aren&#039;t to do with financial reward, but that&#039;s not true at all. The only reason my script is like this is because that&#039;s what I sell.

I sell information on how and advise on how to make more money. That&#039;s just my niche. That&#039;s what I do. I&#039;m giving you my niche as it exists for me, however, you&#039;re going to want to make some changes and some iterations so that it fits for your niche and what you&#039;re offering and selling. Part six, figure out what they want. Here I say, &quot;Okay John, where do you want to grow this business to in the next 12 months?&quot;

If you&#039;re in the health and fitness niche and you&#039;re helping people lose weight, you could say something like, &quot;Okay John, tell me where do you want to get your health and fitness to? Where do you want to get your body weight to in the next 12 months?&quot; In looking for an ideal situation and a desired situation or a desired outcome here, and it doesn&#039;t have to be money. Again, it could be anything. That&#039;s what we want to do. We want to adjust these questions.

You could say, &quot;Okay John, where do you want to get your dating life and your personal relationships to in the next 12 months?&quot; We just adjust it here and then I say, &quot;What&#039;s your motivation for getting to X?&quot; These would still work. Just because I&#039;ve got dollars here doesn&#039;t mean that you can&#039;t change it. I could say, &quot;Okay John, what&#039;s your motivation for getting to 75kg? Which is a weight. What&#039;s your motivation for getting to that? How would things be different for you if you got to 75kg?&quot;

You see, just because I&#039;ve got dollars here and I&#039;m talking about business stuff, it doesn&#039;t mean that you can&#039;t change these things to work for you and your niche and your offer even if its got nothing to do with making money. It still works. We want to make some changes here. Releasing control and self admission. &quot;Okay John, you&#039;re currently making 10,000, you want to get to 50,000, tell me what&#039;s stopping you from getting, from achieving that on your own?&quot;

I could say, &quot;Okay John, you&#039;re currently at 100kgs and you want to get to 75kgs, tell me what&#039;s stopping you from achieving that on your own?&quot; &quot;Okay John, you&#039;re currently, you&#039;ve been on no dates in the past 12 months and you want to start meeting two different woman or going on two different dates each month, tell me what&#039;s stopping you from achieving that on your own?&quot;

You see. Very simple. I just change out the variables. The script works the same way. We&#039;re just helping someone go from the current situation to their desired situation and it just so happens that for me and what I sell and offer, that&#039;s to do with making money, but with you and your business and your niche and offer, that might be different. Feel free to change these things around.

Part eight, gaining commitment and wrapping an emotion. &quot;Okay John, you&#039;re currently making 10,000 a month, why not just stay where you are?&quot; I could say, &quot;Okay John, you&#039;re currently ... You&#039;ve currently been on no dates in the past 12 months, why not just stay where you are?&quot; &quot;Well, okay John, you&#039;re currently 100kgs, why not just stay where you are?&quot; It&#039;s not having this affecting any other areas of your life.

&quot;Okay John, it&#039;s not being it a healthy body weight affecting any other areas of your life.&quot; You get my point here. The script is it&#039;s really awesome because you can fully change it around and adjust it to work for your niche and your offer regardless what that is, even if it&#039;s got nothing to do with money at all. It&#039;s very easy to adjust and change. Part nine is pretty much exactly the same. We don&#039;t change that.

Part ten, state what you are an expert at. Well, my area of expertise is helping blank to blank by blank and I typically work with blank and help them to blank. You&#039;re obviously going to want to change this all around and edit this so that it has your perfect I help blank to blank by blank statement. You fully want to adjust this so that it rolls off your tongue a perfectly and smoothly and powerfully and it fully describes and explains what you do.

This is differently a part you want to edit. In part 11, state your offer and how it works. Here, you want to adjust this so that it fits for you and your offer and what you&#039;re doing, because I doubt that your offer and everything is going to be exactly the same as mine so you&#039;re going to want to adjust to this and change it around. Part 12, state your offer with incentive-based pricing.

Here you edit this to just state your offer and your price and everything. You edit it all around. That&#039;s pretty much it. That is the entire sales script and how we edit it and adjust it for your specific niche and your specific offer. It&#039;s pretty easy to do as you can see. You want to adjust those questions for your particular niche and their problems and desires.

I&#039;ve walked you through that and I&#039;ve shown you the areas which you don&#039;t need to worry about and the areas which you want to adjust and improve. You want to craft your I help blank to blank by blank statement. We&#039;ve already covered that and your offer explanation and get it rolling smoothly off your tongue. We&#039;ve already covered that.

Next step is to anticipate possible objections and come up with rebuttals. Here, in this sales script towards the end, I&#039;ve got handling objections and I&#039;ve got a range of different objections here and the rebuttals to them. For example, I have ... How much time do I have to decide? And then I have said, &quot;How much time do you need to decide?&quot; Right. I know all the common objections that my market has when they do a sales call with me when they&#039;re put into a situation where they have to decide to make an investment.

I know what the objections are because I&#039;ve done a lot of sales calls and I&#039;ve also got a lot of experience doing this, but what you want to do in the beginning is just you want to think what possible objections could come up for me and you don&#039;t need to think about it too much. You just want to come up with probably three or four at max really five of the most obvious objections that you can think of, things that your prospect is going to say and that you&#039;re going to need to have an answer to.

I&#039;m sure everyone can do that and what you want to do is you want to edit these pages here. You can keep my objection handlers if you think these are going to serve you, but you can also add to these and edit these and make adjustments and improvements and things like that. You definitely want to add in an extra three to five objections and rebuttals which you believe you&#039;re going to face when you speak with your market.

That is our step-by-step process for improving the script. Here&#039;s the thing that hardly anybody understands. It doesn&#039;t matter if you&#039;re selling business advice, dating advice, diet advice, fitness advice or any other form of advice. Sales works the same way every single time. Do you remember why people buy? We covered earlier in this training, we discussed the psychology and everything around why people buy and specifically why people buy consulting services.

The reason why people buy is because they&#039;ve got their current situation which is where they are right now so that&#039;s represented with this blue circle, a clearly defined current state, that&#039;s where someone is now and they&#039;ve got these problems and these issues and these things going on. Then someone has their desired situation, a desired future situation and that&#039;s what&#039;s represented with this red circle.

Now, the gap is the distance between these two things. The distance between where someone is right now and where someone wants to be. That is the gap. The reason why people buy and the reason why people buy consulting services is because of these three reasons. Number one is they have an inability to get there on their own.

They&#039;ve tried to get there on their own and they&#039;ve failed or they&#039;ve tripped up and it hasn&#039;t been successful. They&#039;ve got an inability to get there on their own and they need help. Number two is they want to get there faster. They probably understand that they could do it themselves but it might take them quite a long time.

They just want to work with someone who can help fast track that progress and help get them to that desired situation as quickly as possible. Number three is they want to use a proven system and have guidance from somebody who has actually done it. They might know how to do it or they might think that they can figure it out but they just want to follow a system and a step-by-step process because they know if they do it themselves, they&#039;re probably going to mess it up and they just want to get there quickly and without much fuss.

Those are the three reasons why people buy consulting services to go from where they are right now to where they want to be. Then what we&#039;re doing on the sales call is we&#039;re clearly defining someone&#039;s current state and then we&#039;re clearly defining the desired state and then we&#039;re really stretching the gap between these two things. We&#039;re carefully positioning ourselves and our offer as the solution and the vehicle to take the prospect from where they are right now to where they want to be.

That&#039;s what&#039;s represented with this green square in the middle here and it says here on the screen the science of client conversion is creating separation from the agitated current state to two clearly defined and separated states. Once you&#039;ve created separation from the agitated state, you must position you and your offer as the vehicle to bridge the gap between the two states.

The gap between where somebody is now and where they want and where they desire to be in the future, it doesn&#039;t have to be financial like I see it and it can be with any area of both their professional or their personal life. People pay big money in all areas provided there is a problem that you are solving. It&#039;s just all you&#039;re doing with consulting and coaching is helping someone go from their current situation to their desired situation.

You&#039;re helping someone bridge that gap and here&#039;s some examples which aren&#039;t financial. I&#039;m helping people get more clients and make more money. That&#039;s just what I do because that&#039;s what I know how to do best and that&#039;s my niche and that&#039;s what I&#039;ve really spent a lot of time getting good at, but here&#039;s some different examples.

You could have someone who&#039;s currently single with no dates and who is a desire to be dating woman. That is a gap and people are willing to pay money for that. You could have someone who&#039;s currently overweight and unhealthy and they desire to be slim and healthy and there&#039;s a gap. People pay a lot of money for this. You could have someone who&#039;s currently anxious and stressed and who desires to be relaxed and happy and there&#039;s a gap.

A lot of people make a lot of money selling coaching and consulting and advise to people in all of these different states and situations. Like I said, it doesn&#039;t have to be financial. You&#039;d be amazed that people are willing to pay just as much if not more to solve personal problems than financial problems. A lot of the time, if someone is risking, losing their marriage or they&#039;re having serious health issues or if something&#039;s really plaguing their existence, then people are willing to pay any amount of money to solve that.

That&#039;s the real key is when you conduct to your market research correctly and you choose a niche which has a painful problem what you&#039;re solving. You really want to find a serious painful problem. You want to be solving a really painful problem because people are willing to pay and do anything to get rid of the massive problems in their life.

Just because my script is provided in the financial terms, don&#039;t think it can&#039;t be used to sell non-financial services because it absolutely can. I know I might be sounding a little bit repetitive by now by saying it can be used to sell non-financial stuff but, I&#039;ve seen this come up before in the training. People are like, &quot;Oh the script is only for helping, is only for selling people stuff about how to make more money or how to grow their business. I don&#039;t think this will work for me.&quot;

That is not true. You just have to adjust it and iterate it a little bit and it will work extremely well for you. I have a ton of clients who are in all different niches and they&#039;ve done that with my script and they get amazing results. Like I said, I&#039;ve got thousands of success stories of people using the sales script in all areas of business and personal consulting as well.

It works exactly the same. It doesn&#039;t matter if it&#039;s financial or personal or anything. If the problem exists and if there&#039;s a current situation and a desired situation and a gap between the two that is causing pain, the script will work. Now, let&#039;s talk about recording your sales calls and storing them for feedback. This is by far one of the most valuable lessons in sales and you want to record all of your sales calls and refer back to them afterwards to see what went well and what didn&#039;t go well so that you can iterate and improve.

Here&#039;s how we do that. Here&#039;s how we record and store your sales calls. Now, first of all, we need some software to record the calls and there&#039;s two options basically. Number one is you can use Skype call recorder and to download that, you can go to consulting.com/skype-recorder and it is definitely worth the $20 or whatever which it costs to get it. I think they also have a free trial but it is absolutely worth the investment because you will use it, you&#039;re going to be using it a lot and having sales call recordings is going to be the most valuable thing that you have in terms of ability to improve your sales skills.

Having good sales skills and improving your sales skills means money and it means a whole lot more money than $20 for a call recording software. It&#039;s a no brainer. You can go to that link on the screen to see that software and download it. Now, if you don&#039;t want to use Skype on your computer, then you can use an iPhone or an android and there&#039;s a call recording app that works with both of those.

To get that app, you can just go to consulting.com/mobilerecorder, the link is on the screen. You&#039;ve got these two options. It totally depends whether you prefer to use your phone or use your computer and if you want my personal preference and my personal recommendation, my recommendation is to use Skype on your computer with something called a local number and if you Google Skype local number you&#039;ll be able to get one of those few Skype account that cost $5 or something.

Basically, what that is is it will give you a local number for Skype so that when you call people, it just shows your local number on their phone and they just think they&#039;re getting a call from a real phone, not a Skype account, but if you call someone on Skype without having a local number, it&#039;s just going to show all zeros or it&#039;s going to show a weird number and people don&#039;t generally pick up calls like that.

You want to get a local number in your local city or state or town or whatever and then use Skype. Skype is also extremely cheap to make calls. You can get a national, international calling plan for less than $5. I highly recommend Skype and I highly recommend getting a local number so that it displays your local number on your prospect&#039;s caller ID.

This way, you have crystal clear sound. I love the sound quality of Skype. It&#039;s better than the phone and you also have a local number and then when you have the Skype call recorder installed as well, what happens is when you start the call, it automatically starts recording for you. When you hang up and end the call, it automatically saves the recording to any file you want and you don&#039;t even really have to think about it.

You just make the call and then you end it and it&#039;s being recorded and the recording is being saved. It is super simple. It&#039;s a really easy process and I would highly recommend using that one if you want my opinion. I also like to use the standard Apple headphones. There&#039;s the white ear buds, not the wireless ones or anything fancy, just the standard ones.

If you want to know what I use, I really don&#039;t have fancy equipment. I like to keep things as simple as possible. All I use is Skype, I have a local number and then I have the Skype call recorder software installed, I record my calls and I&#039;m just using Apple headphones and I&#039;m doing the calls from my computer. That&#039;s it. Pretty simple and straightforward.

Now let&#039;s talk about filing and storing your sales calls and ... sorry, filing and storing your sales call recordings. Once you&#039;ve completed your sales calls and you have the recording, you want to name it and file it so that you can refer back to it in the future without issues and you want to name the recording using this naming convention. The naming convention is basically a system for naming files. While this won&#039;t make much difference when you&#039;ve just done five or six calls or something, once you&#039;ve done a lot of calls, believe me, you&#039;re going to be really thankful that I taught you how to do this.

What you want to do is you just want to ... When you save the call recording, you want to rename it like this. John Doe, the person you just spoke to. If I spoke to Suzy, I&#039;d write Suzy then the date, today&#039;s date which you did the call. I&#039;ve got 5/10/17 and then the outcome of the call. Was it a yes or was it a no? Maybe it was a maybe. We don&#039;t like maybes remember? We shouldn&#039;t be getting many of those but it should be a yes or a no.

This is a very simple way to save all of your call recordings and this way when you come back and you go looking at them, you can see which ones were yes&#039;s which ones are no&#039;s. You can see the dates and you can see the name of the person who you had the call with. You want to create a folder that uses the following structure. Call recordings and then the month which could be like April 2017 and then you want to split the month into different weeks like week one, week two, week three, week four and then whatever week of the month you&#039;re in, you want to save your call recording within that week.

I&#039;ll give you an example here of what I mean by that. You could open up. You could get a new folder and you could call this call recordings. Within call recordings, you create another new folder and this one could be April 2017 and you could have another month which could be May 2017 so on and so forth. Say in April right now. We could go into here and then we could create one for week one which will be the first seven days of April, then week two which would be the second lot of seven days in April.

The eighth till the 15th and this could be the first to the seventh and then what you want to do is put your sales call recording once you&#039;ve done it into the correct week here, save it in here using this name convention John Doe then the date and then the call outcome, save. Now, what we have is just a very simple way to file and record everything. If I click on call recordings, I can see the different months then within here, I can see the different weeks then I can drill down and see all the different calls and their outcomes and I can listen to them.

Now, this is so powerful because as you get going, you really want to be able to look at how ... look at your performance and look at how things went and be able to drill down and identify the source of any problems if any problems come about. By doing this, if you have a sales slump in say May. Let&#039;s say you have a sales slump in April. You don&#039;t make as much money as you wanted to make. Well, if we want to identify the problem or the cause of that problem, we can just drill down and we can look at how many sales calls you did in each week.

If we look in week one and we see that you only did two sales calls, okay what about week two? You needed one sales call? What about week three? You needed one sales call? Well, of course, you didn&#039;t have an awesome sales month. It&#039;s very easy to identify the problem when these sorts of things happen, but also you might have had a bad sales week. You might be having a slump. What you can do is you can click in into the week and then you can look at all the calls and you can see the outcomes of the calls.

You can drill down and listen to any call. If you&#039;ve had a batch of if for one week straight, you&#039;ve had a whole bunch of no&#039;s, well you can start listening to those calls and see what&#039;s going on, then you could come and look at a different week where you were doing better and you were on a roll in getting nonstop yeses then you could go on to those and listen to those calls and think, &quot;What&#039;s different here?&quot; Like &quot;What is different between this week where I was on a roll and this week now where I haven&#039;t sold anything?&quot;

This very simple, but this is so dead simple. This simple way of naming your call recordings and then structuring your folders so that you can save all of these calls correctly, this is so powerful. It&#039;s so simple to do, it&#039;s like mind-blowingly simple to do this and then the advantage you get from doing it is insane. It is a huge advantage. You definitely want to do this.

I recommend you store all of your call recordings using Google Drive or Dropbox so that they are safe and accessible from any computer at anytime. Don&#039;t just leave them all on your computer without saving them to something because your computer might break or you might be somewhere else for a week or a month or whatever and not have your computer on you or your computer might get stolen or anything could happen.

Your call recordings are extremely important. They literally worth money to you because your call recordings offer you the ability to improve yourself and improve your sales skills. When you improve your sales skills, you improve your ability to make money. When you improve your ability to make money, you make more money. Losing those sales calls therefore is going to cost you a lot of money.

You want to think about it that way. When you think about it that way, you really want to do this correctly. You really want to make sure that you save everything to Google Drive or Dropbox. I personally prefer Google Drive. In that way, I have access to all of my call recordings from any computer or any phone anywhere in the world and I don&#039;t need to worry about anything breaking or me losing all of my call recordings.

I treat those things like they&#039;re seriously important to me because it was going back to those calls and listening to them and everything that really enabled me to get ... that really enabled me to become an amazing sales person and the same will be true for you. Now, let&#039;s talk about action items and the iterative process used to evolve your perfect script.

The term perfect script, I am using that term to describe the script we provide you with when it&#039;s adjusted and iterated so that it fits you perfectly, your niche, your offer, your personality, everything. It&#039;s action time right now. This is the part of the program where the rubber really meets the road and we start making it happen.

We&#039;re going to start to get you on the phone, we&#039;re going to start to close some deals, get some clients, we&#039;re going to start making some money. Let&#039;s discuss the process for evolving your perfect script and there&#039;s two parts to evolving your perfect script. Part one is pre-market script adjustments. Here&#039;s part one. You want to ... It&#039;s pretty much what we covered before.

You want to adjust the script questions so that it fits your niche and your problem and your offer and the results which all the different things which revolve around your niche and the research you&#039;ve done and the offer you&#039;re providing. Earlier on in this training video, I showed you what sections you need to change and adjust. What you want to do right now is download the sales script from week three video two the alchemy of conversion.

Download the script, open it up in PowerPoint all key note and adjust it. Go and make all of those changes which I told you to make so that you can make this your own and make it work for your niche. Then you want to craft your I help blank to blank by blank statement as well as your offer explanation and you want to really get that powerful. You want to get it tight. You want to get it rolling off the tongue smoothly and clearly explaining what you do and you want to get that defined and you want to add it into the script, edited in right now.

You want to anticipate three to five possible objections that your prospect might come to you with and then what you want to do is craft rebuttals to handle those. How are you going to handle that objection? You want to write that down and you want to add it to your script. You want to add it to your key note or PowerPoint file when you want to do that right now. Then you want to read through it a couple of times and get comfortable with it.

Once you&#039;re comfortable with it and you&#039;re like, &quot;Okay, this is good to go.&quot; That&#039;s what we call your version 1.0 script. At this stage, we have done all we can to prepare and now we must go to the market for testing. In part one which is pre-market script adjustments, we&#039;re just doing the best we really can to prepare but we&#039;re not really going to get it perfect until we go to the market and start actually doing some sales calls.

Part one is just getting it the best way possibly can without doing any sales calls and that&#039;s what you want to do right away. Once you&#039;ve done that and you&#039;ve got your version 1.0 script ready to go, well then it&#039;s time to progress to part two which is live market script adjustments. Part two is when we take your version 1.0 script and we go to the market and we go live and we actually start having sales calls and we start signing people up or we start hearing no on the phone or whatever, a mixture of both.

To do this, we use two worksheets. The first one was available in week one and it&#039;s called crafting your MVO. If you go to week one, you will see that there&#039;s a module called crafting your MVO. Now, in that module there is an action item or a resource called niche offer result hypothesis worksheet. We use this worksheet to record feedback from a live market testing when it comes to our niche offer result hypothesis.

Let&#039;s take a look at that right now. I&#039;ve included it for download below this video as well. It&#039;s also available in week one. You should have already filled out a lot of this when you were going through week one. You should have saved it in your action item section. You can download it from your action item section. All of this stuff here, you should have already done it. What we&#039;re going to do is we&#039;re going skip right two, part two which is live market feedback.

Here, where it says start crossing off the numbers as you start speaking with the market in testing your hypothesis by marking them, by making them. The offer stated in this hypothesis worksheet. Sorry I read that wrong. You want to start crossing off the numbers as you start speaking with the market and testing your hypothesis by making your niche, the offer stated in this worksheet.

You should make at least 20 to 30 offers before judging your message hypothesis. Here I&#039;ve got 30, oh it goes all the way up to 50, but as you do each sales call, a real-life sales call, you want to check this off. One, two, you want to start putting a little line or a cross through these. Then, you don&#039;t really want to start thinking, &quot;Is my offer good or is it my script good or anything like that until you&#039;ve done quite a few calls.&quot; If your first call doesn&#039;t go well, who cares? If you first five calls don&#039;t go that well, who cares?

We really don&#039;t want to judge anything until we&#039;ve done at least 30 calls because what we need to do is we need to make sure that we have enough data so that we know we&#039;re dealing with an actual problem and not just some random problem because we spoke to a guy who just was acting strange this one time. That&#039;s what happens. You speak to ... people speak to one person on the phone and the one person says something to them and they think, &quot;Oh, I&#039;ve got to readjust my entire business and that&#039;s the most crazy thing I&#039;ve ever heard.

People are crazy and they say and do weird things and they act strange too. A lot of the time. This is people we&#039;re talking about and I&#039;m sure everyone knows how people can be quite fickle. That&#039;s why we want to make sure that we do enough calls and my recommendation is 30. Don&#039;t be too much of judge of a your script and your offer and everything until you get towards that.

Here. When you&#039;re doing the different sales calls, you want to always be taking notes. Here I&#039;ve got what words or phrases do you hear your prospects repeating over and over again. You want to write these things down or when you go back and listen to your call recordings, you want to listen out for these things and start writing them down. What stories do your prospects like to tell that seem to recur across multiple cause.

You can do these live or when you&#039;re listening to the recordings. What metaphors or analogies do your prospects use? What things does your prospect appear to be bored or saddened talking about and what things does your prospect appear to be excited and energize talking about. What words or sentences or phrases that you used did not resonate with your prospect? What words or sentences or phrases that you used did resonate with your prospects?

To emphasize your key points, what are some of your best metaphors and analogies? As you&#039;re doing your different sales calls, if you say something or if you say an analogy or if you say a metaphor and you&#039;re like &quot;Whoa, it&#039;s pretty good.&quot; Or if you listen to a recording of yourself and you&#039;re like, &quot;Whoa, that thing I said there, that was really good and the person I was speaking to, that really affected him.&quot; He was like, &quot;I&#039;m interested.&quot;

You want to listen out for those things. What things do you say that don&#039;t go well and what things do you say that do go well. Well, you want to write them both down because what we&#039;re basically doing is we&#039;re collecting feedback and we&#039;re improving our script and our process and our entire business so that we do less of what doesn&#039;t work and more of what works. Plain and simple.

This is just a process, a step-by-step framework to doing that, but what we&#039;re really doing is very simple. Just doing more of what works, less of what doesn&#039;t. This worksheet is a way to collect feedback on this and then once you&#039;ve made like 20 or 30 calls, then you can look back over this and then think, &quot;How could I improve my sales script?&quot; and if there&#039;s ways you can improve your sales script, we&#039;ll open up your sales script and make some edits and some changes to it.

You can just edit it in Keynote. If you make some changes to your sales script, you could call the next one version 2.0 of your sales script, then you could do another 30 calls and take feedback, make some changes and what not, then you could create version 3.0 of your sales script. It&#039;s like everything we&#039;re doing in life and business. It&#039;s always an iterative process. We never just define something once and then freeze it and then that&#039;s it.

You can do that if you want but it&#039;s a very bad way to do business and a very bad way to live because it never last for very long. You always want to be listening for feedback and adjusting and changing things so that you can improve. The people who do that in life and business, they just crush it. I can&#039;t describe how much being a business and how much be the general all around people. When they live life and they operate their business using this method.

You always want to be listening to feedback. You always want to be iterating and improving and working on that next version 2.0, version 3.0, version 4.0 or whatever. This is the worksheet to help you do that. Now, there&#039;s a second worksheet which is in week one and the training module resonating your message and it&#039;s called the message hypothesis worksheet. We use this worksheet to record feedback from live market testing when it comes to our message hypothesis.

Let&#039;s take a look at that now. It&#039;s available for download below this video but you should already have a copy of this completed and uploaded in your action item section in week one. Now, this is available for download, you can use just the PDF or you can open it using Google Docs if you click that link. Part one is pre-market but you should have already done all of this in week one.

Then, part two is live market feedback. Just like the other worksheet, we start crossing off the numbers as we do different sales calls. When I work up towards 30. Then we write down what objections is the market giving you? When we speak and we do strategy sessions with people, what objections are they giving us? What things are they saying which aren&#039;t yes? What excuses do they have why they shouldn&#039;t buy or sign up with you.

Well, write them down. As you&#039;re taking notes throughout the sales call, write them down or, listen to your sales call recordings and pick up the different objections people are telling in the recordings and write them down. What things is the market liking or interested in? What things do you say or what issues or topics or words or whatever do you say that they really like or interested in? How are the conversions ending?

What is the conclusion of each call? These different calls what you&#039;re doing, how are they ending? What&#039;s the person saying to you? Write that down and start to notice is there a [inaudible 00:57:30] on these calls, am I always ending up with the same conclusion for every sales call I do? Was it always people that want to think about it? Is it always people who say I need to check with my wife?

What I find is most sales people, they&#039;re just played by this one objection. It&#039;s like sometimes I do an analysis on a sales person, sometimes the very good multi-millionaire successful sales people and they&#039;re like I&#039;m in a slump. I start talking to them and I start conducting my analysis and then I find out that it&#039;s just this one objection. They&#039;ve been acting like it was their niche or their offer or the market&#039;s changed or the economy&#039;s changed or all of these different things because the person&#039;s being emotional because they&#039;re involved in it.

They&#039;re a participant in this experiment and it&#039;s very easy to get emotional and subjective when you&#039;re the participant. When I observe it, I&#039;m like, &quot;Okay, well it&#039;s just this one objection.&quot; I&#039;m like, &quot;What&#039;s your rebuttal to that objection?&quot; They tell me and I&#039;m like that&#039;s a very, very weak rebuttal and I don&#039;t actually think you have a rebuttal because it sounds like you just made that up right now. I drill down to the issue and then I&#039;m like, &quot;Okay, let&#039;s work on a rebuttal, a powerful one right now. How can we tackle this objection?&quot;

We write it out and we get it to the point where we&#039;re like, &quot;Yeah, this is it. This smashes that objection.&quot; I get the guy or girl to practice saying it again and again and we get then we get them back on the phone, then they do the next sales call. They come up against that objection. They say the rebuttal the way we practiced it. Boom. They&#039;re out of their sales slump just like that but you know, sometimes this happens to the best of us. I&#039;ve seen it happen to multimillionaire people who were in sales slumps and a lot of people who were in six figures sales slumps.

It happens to everyone even the best of us and that&#039;s why keeping these sheets and writing things down and recording your calls is so important. I don&#039;t care how good you are in sales. I don&#039;t care if you&#039;re making eight figures or what. You want to do this because it gives you the most powerful tool for looking back and drilling down to root causes of different problems and also iterating and improving and evolving your sales process.

It&#039;s an amazing process to do and I can&#039;t recommend it highly enough. Based on the above state ways in which you can improve your niche offer result hypothesis so you could write down different ways you could improve it. After making 20 to 30 calls, you can start to think, &quot;Well, how could I make some changes to my sales script? Maybe I need to change this around or change this around.&quot; You can make those adjustments.

What you want to do is basically use these two worksheets which we&#039;ve talked about, the niche offer result hypothesis worksheet, we want to be writing feedback down on that. We also want to be using our message hypothesis worksheet. We want to be writing down different things on that. We also want to be recording our calls, saving them to our computer and this might sound like a lot of work now but seriously it&#039;ll just become natural for you after you do five calls.

It might sound like, &quot;Oh man, there&#039;s a lot of stuff going on here.&quot; But it just becomes a flow once you&#039;re used to doing it with sales calls. When I do a sales calls, I just pull out a Moleskine notebook. I print out the person&#039;s survey and I have one of these hypothesis worksheets on my desk and I&#039;m taking notes. I&#039;m writing things down. I always record the calls. After the call, I immediately go and file that recording the correct way.

After so many sales calls, I&#039;m always thinking, &quot;How can I make adjustments to my script or my offer or my message or anyone of these things so that I can improve it and get it closer to what the market wants and what the market needs.&quot; That&#039;s how people build massive earth-shaking businesses is by constantly collecting feedback and constantly trying to iterate and improve to really match what the market wants. It&#039;s really about getting that perfect service to market fit or what I&#039;ve also called message market resonance.

It is insanely powerful. That is part two and those are action items for you to do this week. From here, you will test your hypothesis against the market and collect feedback by taking notes and recording your calls. Every call you do makes you and your script better. Like I said, it&#039;s going to be an iterative process where you create script version one, script version two, script version three every time you do 20, 30 sales calls, you&#039;re going to go back to the drawing board and just adjust some things around.

Don&#039;t worry. You might be thinking, &quot;Oh, this is so much work.&quot; But I&#039;ve done 95% of the work for you. I had to create the script and sales methodology from scratch from a blank page. That took me five years and 1,600 calls to do. I&#039;m giving it to you in its current state which means that all you have to do is just make some tiny iterations and improvements to it. Don&#039;t think, &quot;Oh, I&#039;m going to have to do hundreds of sales calls before I start making sales.&quot; It&#039;s not true.

I know people who start closing deals within their first three, four sales calls. There&#039;s some people in the group who closed their very first sales call. That&#039;s not very common. Most people don&#039;t close their first call. I didn&#039;t but that happens too. Don&#039;t think, &quot;Oh man, I&#039;m not going to be able to make any sales until I get to version four. No way.&quot; All of this is designed to start making sales and start making money immediately, but just making money isn&#039;t enough or not in this training it&#039;s not because just making money like, &quot;I don&#039;t want to just teach people how to make money. I want to teach people how to build incredibly powerful and unstoppable businesses and I want to teach people how to make seven figures, eight figures in more.&quot;

That&#039;s what this process enables you to do because just making money is fine but once you&#039;re just making money, you want to make more and you want to be more efficient and you want to keep improving yourself and keep improving your business and your business processes. You have the best head start a person can possibly have when it comes to sales training and having a script.

This sales training which we&#039;ve got here in week three, the methodology we use, the science behind it and also the script which we provide you with and the different methodology we&#039;ve got for iterating and improving it. It&#039;s the best head start that you can possibly have. 90% of the work is already done for you and now, all you need to do is adjust it, take action and follow the step-by-step process so that you can become one with the script.

When I say become one with the script, as what I was talking about with riding a bike that once you practice it enough or once you make some adjustments to the seat and the handlebars and what not, you don&#039;t think about it anymore. It&#039;s just you&#039;re riding it around and you&#039;re like, &quot;Whoa, this feels like it&#039;s just kind of a part of me.&quot; It&#039;s instinctive and that&#039;s when you get good. You&#039;re not having to think about it and you just become one with it. That&#039;s what good skiers do, that&#039;s what good basketball players do.

They become one with the sports equipment or whatever it is or race car drivers, whatever it is and that&#039;s what practice and iterations and improvements do for you and your sales script. It&#039;ll just become a part of you and it&#039;ll become natural, it&#039;ll become free-flowing and instinctive and that&#039;s when you get really dangerous on the phone when you don&#039;t really have to think about things too much and it&#039;s just all natural.

Believe me, it happens faster than you would imagine. I&#039;ve seen people really become one with their script and get really into the zone within one to two weeks. The sooner you start, the sooner you make these adjustments, complete the action items from this training and the sooner you get out there and you start making sales calls, the sooner you&#039;re going to be able to become one with that script and really start crushing it out of the park.

Let&#039;s get to work. That&#039;s the end of this training video on how to adjust your script and iterate it and improve it. What I want you to do now is complete all the action items which I mentioned in this training module. Download them, complete them, upload them in the action items section and then once you&#039;ve done all of that, awesome. I will see you in the next module. Thanks.
